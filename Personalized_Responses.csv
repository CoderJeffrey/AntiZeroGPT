"Please explain what is ""Animal cognition""","['Animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non-human animals including insect cognition. The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology. It has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology;  the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term animal intelligence are also subsumed within animal cognition.\nResearchers have examined animal cognition in mammals (especially primates, cetaceans, elephants, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, raccoons and rodents), birds (including parrots, fowl, corvids and pigeons), reptiles (lizards, snakes, and turtles), fish and invertebrates (including cephalopods, spiders and insects).']","['Animal cognition refers to the mental capacities of non-human animals. It includes the ability to process information, perceive and attend to stimuli, learn and remember, solve problems, and make decisions. These cognitive abilities are thought to be mediated by brain functions, and research on animal cognition seeks to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying these abilities.\n\n\n\nStudies of animal cognition have been conducted in a variety of species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. These studies have revealed that many animals are capable of sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. For example, some animals are able to use tools, communicate with others, and navigate complex environments.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding animal cognition can provide insight into the evolution of cognitive abilities in humans and other animals, and can also inform the development of animal-friendly practices in fields such as animal welfare, conservation, and animal-assisted therapy.']","Animal cognition refers to the mental abilities and processes of animals. Such abilities include cognitive and information processing, problem-solving, and even linguistic and moral reasoning. Animal cognition has proven to be complex and fascinating, as it explores various aspects of animals' decision-making, perception, memory, and even emotion. For instance, studies have shown that some animals can learn languages or the syntax rules of certain languages, and some others show basic sense of morality and altruism. In sum, the field of animal cognition is to understand and compare the inherent and learned mental processes in animals. From the understanding, researchers hope to apply the knowledges to enhancing human thinking capabilities, both through training and, possibly, through learning how certain animals process thoughts."
"Please explain what is ""Human intelligence""","[""Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. High intelligence is associated with better outcomes in life.\nThrough intelligence, humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate. There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth, or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual's mindset and efforts. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence, are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence. They are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur, though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected.""]","['Human intelligence is the mental ability to think, learn, and understand concepts.

It is often used to improve efficiency, reduce the risk of errors, and make more objective decisions. However, it can also raise ethical concerns, particularly if the algorithms or data used to make the decisions are biased or if the consequences of the decisions are significant.

A strategy game is a game that relies primarily on strategy, and when it comes to defining what strategy is, two factors need to be taken into account: its complexity and game-scale actions, such as each placement in a Total War series. The definition of a strategy game in its cultural context should be any game that belongs to a tradition that goes back to war games, contains more strategy than the average video game, contains certain gameplay conventions, and is represented by a particular community.

"Please explain what is ""Go (game)""","[""Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.\nThe playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.\nThe standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.\nGo was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[10] (c.\u20094th century BCE).[11]\nDespite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1×10170,[12][a] which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, estimated to be of the order of 1080.[14]""]","['Go is a board game that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. It is played on a grid of 19 by 19 lines, with each player starting with an initial allotment of stones of their color (black or white). The goal of the game is to surround a larger total area of the board with your stones than your opponent does with theirs. Players take turns placing their stones on the intersections of the lines on the board, and the game ends when both players pass, indicating that they do not wish to make any more moves.\n\n\n\nThe game is known for its simple rules, but deep strategy and complexity. It is particularly popular in East Asia, and is played professionally in countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. Go has also gained a following in other parts of the world, and international tournaments are held regularly. The game is widely recognized for the unique challenges it presents to players and for the mental discipline and concentration it requires.']","Go is a board game that originated from China. It is played on a 19x19 grid, and the aim of the game is to surround more territory than your opponent. The player can place their stone on any empty grid on the board, and once the stone is placed, it cannot be moved or removed from the board. When the game ends, the player whose stones surround more territory wins. Go has been popular for centuries, and it is viewed as a game with a profound culture background. Unlike chess, Go uses a binary method to compute territory, which make it computation intensive and thus provide opportunities for the application of AI. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as alpha-go has been developed, providing a way to consistently beat human players in Go."

"Please explain what is ""AI winter""","['In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.\nThe term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the ""American Association of Artificial Intelligence""). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky—two leading AI researchers who had survived the ""winter"" of the 1970s—warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion-dollar AI industry began to collapse.\nHype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media. Despite the rise and fall of AI\'s reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that ""there\'s this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day."" In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: ""Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field. Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.""\nEnthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. Beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment.\nQuantum winter is the prospect of a similar development in quantum computing, anticipated or contemplated by Mikhail Dyakonov, Chris Hoofnagle, Simson Garfinkel, Victor Galitsky, and Nikita Gourianov.']","['An ""AI winter"" refers to a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development.

"Please explain what is ""Symbolic AI""","['In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\'s Checker\'s Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]']","['Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems. It is also sometimes referred to as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI).""\n\n\n\nIn symbolic AI, problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules. The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.\n\n\n\nSymbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require logical reasoning and problem-solving, such as natural language processing, planning, and theorem proving.\n\n\n\nHowever, symbolic AI systems have some limitations. They can be difficult to design and implement, and they may require a large amount of human-generated knowledge to be encoded into the system. In addition, they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input.\n\n\n\nToday, symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations.']","Symbolic AI, or symbolic artificial intelligence, is an approach to artificial intelligence that focuses on using symbolic representations and logic-based reasoning to solve complex problems. Unlike other approaches that rely on neural networks and machine learning, symbolic AI first identifies the key logical and symbolic elements in a problem, then develops models and algorithms to reason with these elements.

One advantage of symbolic AI is its ability to handle uncertainty and ambiguity by managing representations at a higher level of abstraction. For example, in a medical diagnostic application, symbolic AI can represent various symptoms and diseases using a unified knowledge base. By applying rules and logical reasoning, symbolic AI can make inferences and provide a more reliable medical diagnosis.

However, symbolic AI often faces difficulties when trying to handle real-world data, as such data tends to be noisy and unstructured. As a result, recent trends have been trying to combine symbolic AI with machine learning, so that the learned models and representations could be further utilized in the symbolic AI system.

Overall, symbolic AI provides us with an alternative way to construct intelligent systems by taking advantage of our knowledge on the task at hand. It has been a classical approach that has greatly influenced the field of AI."

"Please explain what is ""Formal reasoning""","['Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.\nReasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one\'s intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.\nIn contrast to the use of ""reason"" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.\nUsing reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, ""morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one\'s conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.""\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.']","['Formal reasoning is a type of logical argument that follows a specific set of rules and conventions. It is a systematic process that involves making logical inferences based on statements or propositions that are considered to be true or accepted as premises.\n\n\n\nIn formal reasoning, arguments are constructed using deductive or inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning involves starting with a general statement or principle and using it to reach a specific conclusion. Inductive reasoning involves starting with specific observations or examples and using them to reach a general conclusion.\n\n\n\nFormal reasoning is used in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and law. It is an important tool for evaluating and understanding complex systems and for making informed decisions based on logical analysis.']","A formal framework for reasoning about relationships among propositions and is used to check the logical correctness of the reasoning process. Propositional logic and Predicate logic are two commonly used formal reasoning tools. In propositional logic, facts and relationships among them are typically represented by propositions, and reasoning is characterized by deduction, where new propositions are derived from existing ones. Meanwhile, predicate logic uses quantifiers, such as ""for all"" and ""there exist,"" in addition to propositions, and reasoning typically involves both deduction and induction, where new propositions can be derived and/or inferred from existing ones, making it a more expressive logical system."

There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible ""reasonable"" model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory.

"Please explain what is ""Church–Turing thesis""","[""In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the  Turing–Church thesis, the Church–Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:\nChurch, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).\nOn the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.\nSince its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).""]","['The Church-Turing thesis is a fundamental principle in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. It states that any computation that can be performed by a human using pen and paper can also be performed by a machine, as long as it is given the right instructions.

Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic security.\nApplications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including statistical inference, cryptography, neurobiology, perception, linguistics, the evolution and function of molecular codes (bioinformatics), thermal physics, molecular dynamics, quantum computing, black holes, information retrieval, intelligence gathering, plagiarism detection,[10] pattern recognition, anomaly detection[11] and even art creation.']","[""Information theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of the processing, transmission, and storage of information. It was developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a way to formalize the concept of information and to quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted over a given channel.\n\n\n\nThe central idea of information theory is that information can be quantified as a measure of the uncertainty of an event. For example, if you know that a coin is fair, then the outcome of a coin flip is equally likely to be heads or tails, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome of the coin flip is low. On the other hand, if you don't know whether the coin is fair or not, then the outcome of the coin flip is more uncertain, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome is higher.\n\n\n\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is used to quantify the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. The more uncertainty or randomness there is, the higher the entropy. Information theory also introduces the concept of mutual information, which is a measure of the amount of information that one random variable contains about another.\n\n\n\nInformation theory has applications in a wide range of fields, including computer science, engineering, and statistics. It is used to design efficient communication systems, to compress data, to analyze statistical data, and to study the limits of computation.""]","According to Shannon, information can be measured by the amount of uncertainty it can remove. Information theory focuses on finding mathematical representations for symbols, and as a result, find its transmission, storage, and compression. At its core, Information Theory measures the efficiency for us to encode and decode a given set of information. With Information Theory, we can calculate the optimal way to encode a given text and arrive at the optimal destination, which allow us to design efficient codes for compressing that message. The stunning application of Information Theory can be seen in part in data compression and encryption, such as .zip and .rar files. Therefore, Information Theory has a stunningly wide array of applications in coding, entropy, connection, divergence, and error correction codes, to name a few.

"Please explain what is ""Pattern recognition""","['Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. These activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field of application, and they have undergone substantial development over the past few decades.\nPattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled ""training"" data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.\nIn machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is ""spam""). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.\nPattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform ""most likely"" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors.']","['Pattern recognition is the process of identifying patterns and regularities in data.

"Please explain what is ""Domain ontology""","['In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.\nEvery academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. \nEach uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.\nFor instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).\nWhat ontologies in both computer science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).\nApplied ontology is considered a successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles, the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes.

Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.\nThe OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics.

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).\nRegression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes.\nFirst, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning.\nSecond, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset.

On a fundamental level, these quantitative measures of algorithms are important for studying the efficiency of algorithms, which is the most important thing to consider when solving a problem using different approaches. For example, it is important to measure the computational complexity of a problem, since one can prefer  an algorithm only if it requires less memory or CPU. Additionally, in many cases, It is designated as either a singular value or a time-based probability distribution function. Computational complexity must be accounted for when estimating the amount of time or memory required to complete an algorithm on an arbitrary problem instance.

Efficient data usage results in better estimating true gradient and the objective function nearby the true value faster, which, in turn, gives us a more accurate and efficient model.

For example, the sentences ""Pat loves Chris"" and ""Chris is loved by Pat"" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.  Some linguists, Chomsky in particular, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common (or very similar) deep structure.']","['In linguistics, the term ""deep structure"" refers to the underlying meaning and structure of a sentence or phrase, which is thought to be the source of the surface structure or the way that the sentence is actually expressed.

For example, in the sentence “The book was read by Mary,” the surface structure is different from the active voice form, “Mary read the book,” but the deep structure, which conveys the main idea of the sentence, is similar. Deep structure is stable and consistent across all human languages and allows us to understand the meaning of a sentence by using certain universal principles.

It is also relevant to fields such as education, where understanding students' emotional states can help teachers create a positive learning environment.""]","Affect is a concept used in psychology to describe the overall experience and expression of emotions, feeling, and mood. It is often used interchangeably with these terms. Affect can describe both the subjective experience of emotions and the objective display of emotions in our behaviors, facial expression and vocal expression. There are two major dimensions of affect: the positive affect and the negative affect During any given moment in our life, we constantly assess and react to certain situation, which could either increase our positive affect by encouraging us to do a task, or decrease our positive affect by discouraging us to face a certain problem. Similarly, these momental situations could also further increase, or decrease our negative affect, our the assessment of our stress during the day. The concept of affect is important because it tells us that how we experience and express our emotion have a self-amplifying mechanism that could further influence how we aware and interpret events in our daily lives, and in turn could further amplify our affect."

"Please explain what is ""Logical consequence""","['Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?  All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.\nLogical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.\nLogicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n, either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n or by formal intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n.  The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.']","['In logic, a logical consequence is a statement that follows logically from one or more statements. In other words, if the statements are true, then the logical consequence must also be true.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the following statements:\n\n\n\nAll cats are mammals.\n\nFluffy is a cat.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that Fluffy is a mammal. This conclusion follows logically from the first two statements and is therefore a logical consequence of them.\n\n\n\nLogical consequences are important in logical reasoning because they allow us to draw conclusions and make inferences based on the information that we have. They are also important in mathematics, where they are used to prove theorems and other statements.']","Logical consequence is a relationship between statements. Formally, statement A is logically consequent of statements B1, ..., Bk, if and only if it is not possible for B1, ..., Bk to be true and A to be false at the same time. If we view the statements as model of the real world, then we can view logical consequence as a natural language analog of the cause-effect relationship. For example, ""if it is rainy, then the street is wet"" can be viewed as a logical consequence. Logically consequence can be represented in natural language as well as mathematical formula."
"Please explain what is ""Inference rule""","['In the philosophy of logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form ""If p then q"" and another in the form ""p"", and returns the conclusion ""q"". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.\nTypically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference\'s action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.\nPopular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.']","['Inference rules are logical rules that allow you to draw conclusions from given information. They are used in logic and mathematics to deduce new statements based on existing statements, and they can be used to prove the validity of a logical argument or to solve a mathematical problem.\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of inference rules: deductive and inductive.\n\n\n\nDeductive inference rules allow you to draw conclusions that are necessarily true based on given information. For example, if you know that all mammals are warm-blooded, and you know that a particular animal is a mammal, you can deduce that the animal is warm-blooded. This is an example of a deductive inference rule called modus ponens.\n\n\n\nInductive inference rules allow you to draw conclusions that are likely to be true based on given information. For example, if you observe that a particular coin has landed heads up 10 times in a row, you might conclude that the coin is biased toward landing heads up. This is an example of an inductive inference rule.\n\n\n\nInference rules are an important tool in logic and mathematics, and they are used to deduce new information based on existing information.']","Inference rules, also known as transformational rules, are the bridge between the ""given"" information (the premises) and the ""conclusion"" information. Generally, in propositional logic, we have five major types of inference rule: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Disjunctive Syllogism, Hypothetical Syllogism, and Simplification. Each rule either apply on disjunction/double negative/ implicant to allow conclusion with a simpler format. For example, modus ponens states the given ""p->q"" and ""p"", one can easily conclude ""q"". The utilization of various inference rules can gradually transform complex logical express into the simplest form. Even in predicate logic, inference rules are still useful. For example, if we have a rule called universal instantiation that allows us to get a specific subject from a Universal Proposition, then we can get useful information by applying the rule multiple times.

It cooperates with objective function and modifies the partial solution, finally reach an optimized solution. Local search also makes use of Neighborhood Structure to find the promising area. Given the big data scenario, local search needs to be manipulate carefully. For instance, when facing two million tweets from three millions of users, classical local search algorithms would require 100 million comparisons. It doesn't make sense. Thus, local search split out the sampling speaking lists and to indirectly approach Near-optimal solution instead. Local search is the great way to find a sub-optimal solution especially in a big data scenario.

This manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system. Notice that this is a notion of ""unrestricted"" configuration space, i.e. in which different point particles may occupy the same position. In mathematics, in particular in topology, a notion of ""restricted"" configuration space is mostly used, in which the diagonals, representing ""colliding"" particles, are removed.']","['In physics, the configuration space of a system is a space that represents all possible configurations (positions, shapes, etc.) that the system can take. It is an abstract mathematical space that encodes the possible positions and orientations of all the particles in a system.\n\n\n\nThe configuration space is an important concept in classical mechanics, where it is used to describe the motion of a system of particles. For example, the configuration space of a single particle moving in three-dimensional space is simply three-dimensional space itself, with each point in the space representing a possible position of the particle.\n\n\n\nIn more complex systems, the configuration space can be a higher-dimensional space.

The system's configuration specifies the positions of all its parts, so the number of coordinates needed to completely specify the system's configuration is equal to the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the system. 

For a simple free particle moving in 3-dimensional (3-D) spaces, its configuration space is simply a 3-D coordinate space, with each configuration of the particle represented by a unique set of coordinates in the space. For a more complicated system like a double-pendulum (a mass connected by two separate rods via a pivot point), the double-pendulum's configuration space would be a 4-D space with two angles and two angular velocities describing the pendulum's configuration. 

Configuration space brings convenience when we try to solve equations that represent particle's motion(mathematical model of the physics system) on that particle. It generalizes the position to generalized coordinate, which makes so many calculations much more general and practical."

"Please explain what is ""Hill climbing""","[""In numerical analysis, hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search. It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.\nFor example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.\nHill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems – for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space). Examples of algorithms that solve convex problems by hill-climbing include the simplex algorithm for linear programming and binary search.:\u200a253\u200a To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).\nThe relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems, so long as a small number of increments typically converges on a good solution (the optimal solution or a close approximation). At the other extreme, bubble sort can be viewed as a hill climbing algorithm (every adjacent element exchange decreases the number of disordered element pairs), yet this approach is far from efficient for even modest N, as the number of exchanges required grows quadratically. \nHill climbing is an anytime algorithm: it can return a valid solution even if it's interrupted at any time before it ends.""]","['Hill climbing is a heuristic search algorithm that is used to find the local maximum or minimum of a function.

"Please explain what is ""Simulated annealing""","['Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.\nSimulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems.\nThe problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.\nThis notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method.

The probability of accepting a new solution decreases as the algorithm progresses, which helps to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in a local minimum or maximum.\n\n\n\nSimulated annealing is often used to solve optimization problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using other methods, such as problems with a large number of variables or problems with complex, non-differentiable objective functions. It is also useful for problems with many local minima or maxima, as it can escape from these local optima and explore other parts of the search space.\n\n\n\nSimulated annealing is a useful tool for solving many types of optimization problems, but it can be slow and may not always find the global minimum or maximum. It is often used in combination with other optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the optimization process.']","In simulated annealing, we want to mimic the cooling process of metals. A high-temperature and random search initially allow the simulator to explore the entire solution space uninhibitedly. The Search swaps elements of the solution randomly and make small pertubation indiscriminately. Then, through a simulated cooling process, we reduce the rate of accepting worse solution. By viewing solution, we generating the energy. We swap with neighbour solution with a probalistic change. By this means, even though we are stuck in a local equilibrium, we are likely to hop off and found a better one.

"Please explain what is ""Artificial selection""","['Selective breeding (also called artificial selection) is the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together. Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, cultivars, or breeds. Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.\nIn animal breeding, techniques such as inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing are utilized. In plant breeding, similar methods are used. Charles Darwin discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons, cats, cattle, and dogs. Darwin used artificial selection as a springboard to introduce and support the theory of natural selection.\nThe deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.\nSelective breeding can be unintentional, for example, resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended – desirable or undesirable – results. For example, in some grains, an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds. Most likely, there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication.']","[""Artificial selection is a process by which humans breed plants and animals for specific traits or characteristics. It is a form of selective breeding in which humans deliberately choose which individuals will reproduce, based on their desired traits. This is in contrast to natural selection, which is the process by which traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction are passed on to future generations through the process of evolution.\n\n\n\nArtificial selection has been used for thousands of years to breed domesticated animals and plants for various purposes, such as increasing their size, improving their flavor, or enhancing their appearance. For example, humans have bred cattle for meat, milk, and leather; dogs for hunting, herding, and guarding; and crops for yield, taste, and disease resistance.\n\n\n\nArtificial selection can also be used in the laboratory setting to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In this process, scientists can use techniques such as gene editing to introduce specific traits into an organism's genome, or they can transfer genes from one organism to another using techniques such as genetic engineering.\n\n\n\nOverall, artificial selection is a powerful tool that has had a significant impact on the diversity of plants and animals that we see today, and it continues to be an important area of research and development in the field of biology.""]","Artificial selection is the human manipulation of organism's reproductive processes to result in offspring with desired traits. In other word, 'artificial selection' can be seen as breeding. Artificial selection is often used in the context of plants and animals. Farmers and breeders has been selecting organism that have desirable traits since before recorded history. One of the most common examples of 'artificial' selection is the domestication of animals. Take dogs for example, dogs were bred to be friendlier and less aggressive, and at the same time, their size, their appearance, their fur color etc are also well considered. Because of that, we now have more than 400 different breeds of dogs. In the Animal agriculture business, breeders select cows with extremely large amounts of milk production to mate, which has resulted in cow with very high milk production. Another influential example in biology is Darwin's finches. Students will find this example very helpful to understand ""artificial selection"" because by comparing the finches in the Galapagos Island with the rest of the world, Charles Darwin recognized that the beak of the finches can evolve according to their feeding availabilities."

Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty.

"Please explain what is ""Particle swarm optimization""","[""In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.

Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.\nAs an example, ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.

They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\nAnts form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called ""drones"" and one or more fertile females called ""queens"" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in moist tropical ecosystems and may exceed the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.\nAnt societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems. These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rites. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings.

Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesised logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples. Inductive programming synthesizes productive solutions to problems of this kind, thus obviating the necessity for a reliance on search techniques. Moreover, a concept learning system that uses the ILP model to learn may provide further explanation of its decision-making process. Using the knowledge provided by the learned hypotheses, the user not only takes advantage of the concepts learned or decisions made, but also investigates such processes."
"Please explain what is ""Propositional logic""","['Propositional calculus is a branch of logic.  It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. Propositions that contain no logical connectives are called atomic propositions.\nUnlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers.

By formally articulating sense-making process, it allows us to reason and create logical arguments. For instance, by dissecting real-life arguments into propositions and applying truth-table, we could assess whether the argument is valid or not. By sunsetting open-ended analysis, propositional logic has significant influence on machine learning as it streamlines computational processes and automatize linguistic categorizations."
"Please explain what is ""Truth function""","['In logic, a truth function is a function that accepts truth values as input and produces a unique truth value as output. In other words: The input and output of a truth function are all truth values; a truth function will always output exactly one truth value; and inputting the same truth value(s) will always output the same truth value. The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives; if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and any logical connectives used are said to be truth functional.\nClassical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function. On the other hand, modal logic is non-truth-functional.']","['A truth function, also known as a Boolean function, is a function in logic that takes in a number of input values and outputs a single true or false value.

These statements can be represented using truth functions by assigning truth values to the variables involved (e.g., ""raining"" is true, ""grass is wet"" is true) and applying the appropriate logical connectives (e.g., ""if-then,"" ""or"").\n\n\n\nThere are several common truth functions in propositional logic, including:\n\n\n\nAND: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if both inputs are true, and false otherwise.\n\nOR: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if at least one of the inputs is true, and false otherwise.\n\nNOT: This function takes in a single input value and outputs the opposite value (e.g., true becomes false, and false becomes true).\n\nIF-THEN: This function takes in two input values and outputs true if the first input (the ""if"" part) is false or the second input (the ""then"" part) is true, and false otherwise.\n\nTruth functions are a fundamental concept in logic and are used in many different areas of computer science and mathematics, including computer programming, automated reasoning, and artificial intelligence.']","A truth function, which expresses a logical operator, can return a value of either “True” or “False” based on the value of one or more inputs.

For and ""AND"" truth function, the output will be true only when A is true and B is true. The NOT function will only return the opposite of the inputting value. In general, a truth function can have inputs, can be composed of one or more truth functions, and may have more than one input. The derived truth table can reveal the relationship between inputs and outputs and help establish other important properties.

"Please explain what is ""First-order logic""","['First-order logic—also known as predicate logic, quantificational logic, and first-order predicate calculus—is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ""Socrates is a man"", one can have expressions in the form ""there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man"", where ""there exists"" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations; in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.\nA theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. Sometimes, ""theory"" is understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic.\nThe adjective ""first-order"" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates or functions, or both, are permitted.:\u200a56\u200a In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.\nThere are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (i.e., all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.\nFirst-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms, and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.\nPeano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.\nNo first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.\nThe foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce.

"Please explain what is ""Quantifier (logic)""","['In logic, a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula.

A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula. A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable.\nThe mostly commonly used quantifiers are \n\n\n\n∀\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall }\n\n and \n\n\n\n∃\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exists }\n\n. These quantifiers are standardly defined as duals; in classical logic, they are interdefinable using negation. They can also be used to define more complex quantifiers, as in the formula \n\n\n\n¬\n∃\nx\nP\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\neg \\exists xP(x)}\n\n which expresses that nothing has the property \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. Other quantifiers are only definable within second order logic or higher order logics. Quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström.\nIn a first-order logic statement, quantifications in the same type (either universal quantifications or existential quantifications) can be exchanged without changing the meaning of the statement, while the exchange of quantifications in different types changes the meaning. As an example, the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is the order of quantifications.\nFirst order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as ""some"" and ""all"". However, many natural language quantifiers can only be analyzed in terms of generalized quantifiers.']","['In logic, a quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies the quantity or extent of the elements in the domain of a logical statement. There are two types of quantifiers: universal quantifiers and existential quantifiers.\n\n\n\nA universal quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies that a particular statement holds for all elements in the domain of the statement. For example, the statement ""For all x, x is a number"" is a universal statement because it asserts that the property of being a number holds for every element in the domain of x. In symbolic logic, the universal quantifier is usually represented by the symbol ""∀"".\n\n\n\nAn existential quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies that there exists at least one element in the domain of a logical statement that satisfies a particular condition.

In symbolic logic, the existential quantifier is usually represented by the symbol ""∃"".\n\n\n\nQuantifiers play a crucial role in formal logic and are used to make more complex statements about the relationships between different elements in a logical domain.

On the contrary, in a statement like ""Exists x, P(x)"", the existential quantifier (∃) is indicating that there is a value of x that serves as a subset of the given domain, which makes P holds true. To that extent, quantifier also works with the predicate to make the sentence true or false. In mathematical expression, the predicate is akin to what you would like to prove and the quantifier is akin to the range.

Second, it has a set of repeated boolean logic operaters such as AND, OR, NOT , which operate on the sentence. Final, it has a set of Quantifiers, such as Existential Quantifiers, which control the variable inside the sentence, making them become Universal or bound variables, and control the truth value of the final sentence.

This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified.

"Please explain what is ""Circumscription (logic)""","['Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic created by John McCarthy to formalize the common sense assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified. Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the frame problem. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented first-order logic  to allow the minimization of the extension of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the closed-world assumption that what is not known to be true is false.\nThe original problem considered by McCarthy was that of missionaries and cannibals: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank of a river; they have to cross the river using a boat that can only take two, with the additional constraint that cannibals must never outnumber the missionaries on either bank (as otherwise the missionaries would be killed and, presumably, eaten). The problem considered by McCarthy was not that of finding a sequence of steps to reach the goal (the article on the missionaries and cannibals problem contains one such solution), but rather that of excluding conditions that are not explicitly stated. For example, the solution ""go half a mile south and cross the river on the bridge"" is intuitively not valid because the statement of the problem does not mention such a bridge. On the other hand, the existence of this bridge is not excluded by the statement of the problem either. That the bridge does not exist is\na consequence of the implicit assumption that the statement of the problem contains everything that is relevant to its solution. Explicitly stating that a bridge does not exist is not a solution to this problem, as there are many other exceptional conditions that should be excluded (such as the presence of a rope for fastening the cannibals, the presence of a larger boat nearby, etc.)\nCircumscription was later used by McCarthy to formalize the implicit assumption of inertia: things do not change unless otherwise specified.  Circumscription seemed to be useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; this is known as the frame problem. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the Yale shooting problem scenario. Other solutions to the frame problem that correctly formalize the Yale shooting problem exist; some use circumscription but in a different way.']","['In logic and artificial intelligence, circumscription is a method of reasoning that allows one to reason about a set of possible worlds by considering the minimal set of assumptions that would make a given formula true in that set of worlds.

All and only the information specified in the problem is preserved. Ordinarily, in circumscription, a formula with free variables X1, Xn is introduced to describe what is preserved in each world. alleged to be true in each of all the possible worlds.

There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.\nDLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profiles are based on DLs.

Therefore, with trying to perceive logic and reasoning through perception in a domain, SC successfully allows robot to plan, execute and specify tasks through consistent reasoning.  

On far side, SC doesn't support hardware abstractions and focuses on only the logical and reasoning scenarios. In case the human keep providing new or challenging logic questions to SC, the robot would be keep reasoning based on SC. For example, in case SC assumed robot could not perceive bojects behind the wall, it would be hard for the robot to overtime and empirically learn to update it's perception.

"Please explain what is ""Kalman filter""","['For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary developers of its theory.\nThis digital filter is sometimes termed the Stratonovich–Kalman–Bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general, nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the Soviet mathematician Ruslan Stratonovich. In fact, some of the special case linear filter\'s equations appeared in  papers by Stratonovich that were published before summer 1960, when Kalman met with Stratonovich during a conference in Moscow.\nKalman filtering has numerous technological applications. A common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly aircraft, spacecraft and ships positioned dynamically. Furthermore, Kalman filtering is a concept much applied in time series analysis used for topics such as signal processing and econometrics. Kalman filtering is also one of the main topics of robotic motion planning and control and can be used for trajectory optimization.[10] Kalman filtering also works for modeling the central nervous system\'s control of movement. Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback, the use of Kalman filters[11] provides a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of a motor system and issuing updated commands.[12]\nThe algorithm works by a two-phase process. For the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.\nOptimality of Kalman filtering assumes that errors have a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  In the words of Rudolf E. Kálmán: ""In summary, the following assumptions are made about random processes: Physical random phenomena may be thought of as due to primary random sources exciting dynamic systems. The primary sources are assumed to be independent gaussian random processes with zero mean; the dynamic systems will be linear.""[13]  Though regardless of Gaussianity, if the process and measurement covariances are known, the Kalman filter is the best possible linear estimator in the minimum mean-square-error sense.[14]\nExtensions and generalizations of the method have also been developed, such as the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The basis is a hidden Markov model such that the state space of the latent variables is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions. Kalman filtering has been used successfully in multi-sensor fusion,[15] and distributed sensor networks to develop distributed or consensus Kalman filtering.[16]']","['The Kalman filter is a mathematical method used to estimate the state of a system from noisy and incomplete observations. It is often used in the fields of engineering, economics, and computer science for tasks such as signal processing, sensor fusion, and state estimation.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter is based on the idea of recursive Bayesian filtering, which involves repeatedly updating the probability distribution over the state of the system based on new observations and process model. It works by combining an initial estimate of the state of the system with additional information from noisy observations to produce a more accurate estimate.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter involves two steps: prediction and correction. In the prediction step, the filter uses a process model to predict the state of the system at the next time step based on the current estimate and any additional control inputs. In the correction step, the filter updates the estimate based on new observations, using a measurement model to relate the observations to the state of the system.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter can be used for both linear and nonlinear systems, and it is often used in applications where the system being modeled is uncertain or the observations are noisy.

Then, different decision alternatives are assessed and evaluated by integrating all available information and conducting analysis using various decision analysis techniques, such as decision trees, influence diagrams, and value of information analysis. The results of the analysis are used to quantify the expected value or utility associated with each decision alternative and to make the best-informed decision. Decision analysis can be applied to various fields, including business, engineering, public policy, and healthcare, to help decision-makers make optimal decisions and manage risks in complex decision-making scenarios."
"Please explain what is ""Markov decision process""","['In mathematics, a Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete-time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard\'s 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes.

A Markov Decision Process can help answer two key questions: What actions should be taken in different states and the potential consequences of making such decisions.

There are several components that makes up a Markov Decision process,including the states and actions available to agents to take, the rewards that the agents would have received for taking certain actions, and the defined transition probability.

Additionally, there are three types of Markov policies, deterministic, uniform and MARKOV. A policy describes the decision-making strategy the agents should take, and they could range from taking a fixed action for all the states (deterministic) to a range of possible actions taking in respective states(MARKOV)

By solving and retrieving the decision-making strategies, decision-makers can take advantage of this into application and maximize their reward within the problem. Some examples of applying CCP could be stock keeping and marketing plan-making etc. It could be seen as a powerful optimization tool to maximize efficiency and hence revenue."

Before going further, mechanism design usually refers to the design and the study of interaction protocols using economic incentives in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Such protocols are referred to as mechanisms, and the derived outcome referred to as the implemented outcome. 

Most economic interactions can be abstracted using a few general factors: There are multiple participants with different preferences, and they all desire to maximize their own utility. Participants in the interaction don’t share information, and some don’t even want to be truthful. There you might say, typical economics market usually does not have such preferences and assumptions. In fact, the classic wealth distribution paradigm, a pivotal part of many economic interactions, is built upon such an abstract.

Hebbian learning is thought to play a role in a variety of cognitive processes, including learning, memory, and decision making.\n\n\n\nHebbian learning is different from other types of learning, such as classical conditioning or reinforcement learning, in that it does not rely on the reinforcement of specific behaviors or the association of stimuli with particular outcomes. Instead, it is based on the idea that the brain changes in response to experience and that these changes can be permanent.']","Hebbian learning is a theory in neuroscience that states that the strength of the connection between two neurons increases when the two neurons are simultaneously active, and decreases when the two neurons are firing asynchronously.  In other words, ""Cells that fire together wire together.""  This phenomenom is due to the fact that synapses that are repeatedly active will increase the post synaptic neuron's behavior as well as its sensitivity to its own pre-synaptic neuron.  This effectively makes the cell more likely to fire again and therefore strengthens the initial synaptic connection.  Moreover, the learning is bidirectional, which means that if a neuron fires and another neuron fires, the synapse connecting the pre-synaptic neuron to the post-synaptic neuron is also strengthened.  Hebbian synaptic plasticity is therefore thought to be a cool neural mechanism for learning and memory."

The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.\nGradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.']","['Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients and biases) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function.\n\n\n\nIn machine learning, we often want to find the parameters that minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

At each step, the algorithm computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient is a vector that indicates the direction of steepest descent. The algorithm then updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, since this will reduce the cost. This process is repeated until the cost function is minimized or until a predefined number of iterations is reached.\n\n\n\nThere are several variations of the gradient descent algorithm, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. The choice of which variant to use depends on the specific problem and the available computational resources.']","Gradient descent is the fundamental optimization algorithm in deep learning. It iteratively adjusts the parameters of the model in order to minimize the loss function. In each iteration, it first computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter.

By taking such steps iteratively, the algorithm is able to explore the space of parameters, eventually leading to the optimal or near-optimal configuration in terms of minimizing the loss function. "

"Please explain what is ""Receptive field""","[""The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms.\nComplexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.\nA sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body. For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.\nThe term receptive field was first used by Sherrington in 1906 to describe the area of skin from which a scratch reflex could be elicited in a dog. In 1938, Hartline started to apply the term to single neurons, this time from the frog retina.\nThis concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field for a cell in the brain. This process is called convergence.\nReceptive fields have been used in modern artificial deep neural networks that work with local operations.""]","['In the context of computer vision and image processing, the receptive field of a neuron in a neural network refers to the region of the input image that the neuron is ""looking at"" or ""receiving information from.""\n\n\n\nFor example, in a convolutional neural network (CNN), the receptive field of a neuron in the first convolutional layer is determined by the size and stride of the convolutional kernel being applied at that layer. As the input image is passed through the network and the kernels are applied, the receptive field of each neuron grows larger, as it is receiving information from a larger region of the input image.\n\n\n\nThe size and shape of the receptive field can have a significant impact on the performance of a neural network, as it determines the context that the neuron is able to consider when making a prediction. A larger receptive field allows a neuron to consider more context from the input image, which can be beneficial for tasks such as object recognition, where it is important to consider the relationships between different parts of the image. However, a larger receptive field also requires more computation and can make the network more prone to overfitting, so it is important to balance the size of the receptive field with the needs of the task at hand.']","The receptive field is a crucial concept in computer vision. When in images processing and an image convolves with a filter, the context information of an central pixel region is captured as the Receptive field. To be more specific, the Receptive fields contain the sum of the feature maps in the previous convolutions(and may further adopt the pooling layer), and to form a feature volume in which the information is all are gained from the original image. 

The main problem of receptive field is from the existence of the pooling operation. Since pooling will force the output has small receptive fields, it will reduce the spatial size of the input, and as a result, reduce the receive field. What worse is that if we simply increase the size of the input to increase the receive field, it will cost A LOT, in terms of the computational cost. 

Recently proposed ASPP appears to solve this problem. ASPP uses additional 1×1 convolution layers to warp the feature and generate parallel dilated convolution branches. By combining can effectively make a pooling-offset on the feature and achieve a global context reception. 

Receptive Fields applies extensive applications like object detection and semantic segmentation. It may also be combined with the strategy of consistent accuracy and performance. Implement such structural ameliorations can largely boost the quality of research and should always be considered during research."

From the challenges originated from sentiment analysis, grammar ambiguity, and information extracting, NLP needs to consider both the vulnerability in language-computing tasks and the effectiveness in providing sustainable support for users. Critical real-world applications including translation, super-question answering, and smart QA systems all rely heavily on NLP. Specifically, NLPs can not only provide a more customized answer to users based on their queries but also give suggestions and potential approaches."
"Please explain what is ""AlphaFold 2""","['AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which performs predictions of protein structure.

The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. \nA team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020. The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group. It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP\'s global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.\nAlphaFold 2\'s results at CASP were described as ""astounding"" and ""transformational."" Some researchers noted that the accuracy is not high enough for a third of its predictions, and that it does not reveal the mechanism or rules of protein folding for the protein folding problem to be considered solved. Nevertheless, there has been widespread respect for the technical achievement.\nOn 15 July 2021 the AlphaFold 2 paper was published at Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes.[10][11][12]']","['AlphaFold 2 is a machine learning system developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.

The program then attempts to construct a proof of the theorem by systematically applying the axioms and rules in a logical manner. If the program is successful, it will output a proof of the theorem; if it is not, it will either report that the theorem is not provable within the given logical system, or it will run indefinitely without finding a proof.\n\n\n\nAutomated theorem provers have a wide range of applications, including verifying the correctness of software and hardware systems, assisting in the development of new mathematical results, and helping to formalize and automate various branches of mathematics.

"Please explain what is ""Turing test""","['The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine\'s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine\'s ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine\'s ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.\nThe test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: ""I propose to consider the question, \'Can machines think?\'"" Because ""thinking"" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to ""replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the ""imitation game"", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing\'s new question is: ""Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?"" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that ""machines can think"".\nSince Turing introduced his test, it has been both highly influential and widely criticised, and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Some of its criticisms, such as John Searle\'s Chinese room, are themselves controversial.']","[""The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

If the judge cannot reliably tell which is the machine and which is the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Test is often used as a benchmark for determining whether a machine exhibits artificial intelligence, although it is not a perfect measure. Some critics argue that the test is too limited in scope, as it only measures a machine's ability to mimic human conversation and does not take into account other forms of intelligent behavior. Others argue that the test is too subjective, as it relies on the judgments of individual human judges.

Overall, the test requires that a human evaluator engage in two separate natural language conversations, one with a human and one with a machine, without knowing which one is which. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the two conversations, then the machine is said to have passed the test. Moreover, the test put forward the question of whether machines can think and signaled the onset of the age of computer science.

Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software\'s initial design.\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single ""algorithm"" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.']","['Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic and unfair discrimination that occurs when algorithms and automated systems are used to make decisions that affect people. It can occur when an algorithm is trained on biased data or when the algorithm itself is designed in a biased way. Algorithmic bias can have serious consequences for individuals and society, as it can perpetuate and amplify existing biases and inequalities.\n\n\n\nFor example, if an algorithm is trained to predict who is likely to default on a loan, and the training data is biased because it disproportionately includes data on people from certain racial or socioeconomic groups who are more likely to default, the algorithm may be biased against those groups. This could result in people from those groups being unfairly denied loans or being offered less favorable terms. Similarly, if an algorithm is designed to screen job applicants and is biased against certain groups, it could result in those groups being unfairly excluded from job opportunities.\n\n\n\nIt is important to recognize and address algorithmic bias in order to promote fairness and avoid negative consequences for individuals and society. This can involve designing algorithms in an unbiased way, using diverse and representative training data, and implementing safeguards to prevent and mitigate bias in automated decision-making systems.']","Means that machine learning has its own bias due to data being trained on 결 corp.By trained on historical data, algorithms could easily capture and amplify the 인오 inherent biases in the result.

"Please explain what is ""Noam Chomsky""","['Avram Noam Chomsky[a] (born December 7, 1928) is an American public intellectual: a linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian,[b] social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called ""the father of modern linguistics"",[c] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\nBorn to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.\nAn outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his anti-war essay ""The Responsibility of Intellectuals"". Becoming associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon\'s list of political opponents. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of unconditional freedom of speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\nOne of the most cited scholars alive,[d] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, contemporary state capitalism, U.S. involvement and Israel\'s role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. Chomsky and his ideas are highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.']","[""Noam Chomsky is a linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, and social critic.

"Please explain what is ""Explainable AI""","['Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.  XAI is relevant even if there is no legal right or regulatory requirement. For example, XAI can improve the user experience of a product or service by helping end users trust that the AI is making good decisions. This way the aim of XAI is to explain what has been done, what is done right now, what will be done next and unveil the information the actions are based on. These characteristics make it possible (i) to confirm existing knowledge (ii) to challenge existing knowledge and (iii) to generate new assumptions.\nThe algorithms used in AI can be differentiated into white-box and black-box machine learning (ML) algorithms. White-box models are ML models that provide results that are understandable for experts in the domain. Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and can hardly be understood even by domain experts.[10] XAI algorithms are considered to follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability and explainability. Transparency is given “if the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer”.[11] Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans.[12][13][14] Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a joint definition is not yet available.[11] It is suggested that explainability in ML can be considered as “the collection of features of the interpretable domain, that have contributed for a given example to produce a decision (e.g., classification or regression)”.[15] If algorithms meet these requirements, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.[16]\nSometimes it is also possible to achieve a result with high accuracy with a white-box ML algorithm that is interpretable in itself.[17] This is especially important in domains like medicine, defense, finance and law, where it is crucial to understand the decisions and build up trust in the algorithms. Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning, the way forward is symbolic regression, where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset.[18][19][20]\nAI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command ""maximize accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset"". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as ""reviews containing the word \'horrible\' are likely to be negative"". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as ""reviews containing \'Daniel Day-Lewis\' are usually positive""; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the train set, or if people consider the rule to be ""cheating"" or ""unfair"". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.[21]']","['Explainable AI, also known as XAI, refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their decision-making processes and predictions.

This is important because it can help to increase trust in AI systems, as well as improve their effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere are various approaches to building explainable AI, including using simpler models, introducing human-readable rules or constraints into the AI system, and developing techniques for visualizing and interpreting the inner workings of AI models.\n\n\n\nExplainable AI has a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, and government, where transparency and accountability are critical concerns.

For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 is the current state-of-the-art model in text generation, however explaining GPT-3 becomes incredibly difficult because neither the users nor it's developers know how the different components of the model interact with each other. However, models such as Captum, also developed by PyTorch, helps on addressing explainability by using Gradient-Tracing and other algorithms to help developers to understand the behavior and outcome of a particular AI model. Open-source libraries like Captum not only help as an explainability tool but also provides transparency to the black box AI systems."
"Please explain what is ""Neural networks""","['A neural network is a network or circuit of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus, a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled in artificial neural networks as weights between nodes. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1.\nThese artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.']","['Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems.  As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do.

Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

"Please explain what is ""Philosophy of mind""","['Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the ontology and nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. The mind–body problem is a paradigmatic issue in philosophy of mind, although a number of other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness and the nature of particular mental states. Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and its neural correlates, the ontology of the mind, the nature of cognition and of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.\nDualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly.\nMost modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive physicalist or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.[15] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of sociobiology, computer science (specifically, artificial intelligence), evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences.[16][17][18][19] Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.[20][21][22] Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance, mental properties supervene on physical properties, or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.[23][24] Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues; however, they are far from being resolved.  Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms.[25][26]\nHowever, a number of issues have  been recognized with non-reductive physicalism. First, it is irreconcilable with self-identity over time. Secondly, intentional states of consciousness do not make sense on non-reductive physicalism.

For example, when we see an object, our brain processes visual information about its size, shape, and color, and uses this information to identify the object. When we hear a sound, our brain processes auditory information and uses it to understand what is being said. When we read or write, our brain processes linguistic information and uses it to communicate with others.\n\n\n\nInformation processing is a key aspect of cognition, which is the mental process by which we acquire, process, store, and use information.

The information processing model suggests that information flows through a series of stages, including input, encoding, storage, and retrieval. This model also emphasizes the importance of attention and working memory, as they actively select, filter, and manipulate information in the process. 

The study of information processing has wide applications in areas such as education and psychology.

"Please explain what is ""Subjective experience""","['In philosophy of mind, qualia (/ˈkwɑːliə/ or /ˈkweɪliə/; singular form: quale) are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective quālis (Latin pronunciation:\xa0[ˈkʷaːlɪs]) meaning ""of what sort"" or ""of what kind"" in a specific instance, such as ""what it is like to taste a specific apple\u200a—\u200athis particular apple now"".\nExamples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to propositional attitudes, where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing.\nPhilosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett once suggested that qualia was ""an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us"".\nMuch of the debate over their importance hinges on the definition of the term, and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia. Consequently, the nature and existence of qualia under various definitions remain controversial. While some philosophers of mind like Daniel Dennett argue that qualia do not exist and are incompatible with neuroscience and naturalism, some neuroscientists and neurologists like Gerald Edelman, Antonio Damasio, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch and Rodolfo Llinás state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.[10][11][12][13][14][excessive citations]']","[""Subjective experience refers to the personal, individual experience of the world and one's own thoughts, feelings, and sensations.

"Please explain what is ""Mind-body problem""","[""The mind–body problem is a philosophical debate concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. The debate goes beyond addressing the mere question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically. Interactionism arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.\nThe problem was popularized by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism, and by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, in Avicennian philosophy, and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality as in neutral or substance or essence, in terms of which everything can be explained.\nEach of these categories contains numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism, which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and property dualism, which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes; and neutral monism, which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).\nSeveral philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment. An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism, and is a position that generally characterized post-war Continental philosophy.\nThe absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension (if there is such a thing) has been raised as a criticism of dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.[10] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.[11][12][13][14]\nAn ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model, described in the Buddhist teachings, explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.[15] Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual's mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.[15]""]","[""The mind-body problem is a philosophical question that asks how the mind and the body are related. It has been a central issue in philosophy for centuries, and it has implications for how we understand the nature of consciousness, the self, and the relationship between the mind and the physical world.\n\n\n\nOne way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider whether the mind is a distinct entity from the body, or whether it is simply a product of the body's physical processes. This is known as the dualist view. Dualists believe that the mind and the body are separate entities that interact with each other, but are not identical.\n\n\n\nAnother way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider the mind and the body as two different aspects of the same thing. This is known as monist view. Monists believe that the mind and the body are not separate entities, but rather different ways of looking at the same thing.\n\n\n\nThere are many different philosophical theories that have been proposed to try to solve the mind-body problem, but it remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion.""]","The mind-body problem is a philosophical conundrum that has been the topic of debate for millennia. It concerns the relationship between the mind and the body, and whether they are separate entities or if they are intertwined somehow. Dualists argue that the mind and body are distinct and can exist independently of each other, while materialists argue that mental phenomena can be reduced to physical processes in the brain. Another approach, known as the neutral monist, suggests that both the mind and the body are composed of a common substance. Resolving the mind-body problem is a crucial step in understanding how consciousness is generated, in providing effective pain relief, and in realizing more advanced Artificial Intelligence systems that could exhibit human-like perception, knowledge, reasoning, and decision making capabilities. Overall, the difficulty of fully comprehending the mind-body problem has made it a deeply contested issue."
"Please explain what is ""Jerry Fodor""","['Jerry Alan Fodor (/ˈfoʊdər/; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73–75\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.']","['Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.

He went on to earn his PhD from Princeton University in 1960.\n\n\n\nFodor is best known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind, particularly his defense of the idea that the mind is a modular system. This view holds that the mind is composed of a number of independent systems or modules, each of which is specialized for processing a particular type of information. Fodor argued that these modules are innate and dedicated to specific tasks, such as perception, language, and reasoning. He also proposed that mental states are individuated by their causal roles, which he called ""functional roles.""\n\n\n\nFodor was also a leading figure in the development of the theory of computationalism, which holds that the mind is a computational system and that mental processes can be understood in terms of computations. He argued that mental states can be explained in terms of the information that they carry and the operations that they perform on that information.\n\n\n\nFodor\'s work has had a significant influence on the field of cognitive science and has been widely discussed and debated within the philosophy of mind.

His major contributions include his critical responses to both empiricism and computational theories of the mind, his critiques of other philosophical theories such as functionalism and acquaintance theories, and his defenses of intentional realism and his views on concepts. In cognitive science, the context holism view he developed with Zenon Pylyshyn criticizes computational theories of mind and introduced doxastic theories of vision and the problem of ""catastrophic concept combination."" Fodor's linguistic Relativities argument states that thoughts must precede language acquisition, which attempts to explain linguistic recycling problems. Finally, the Fodor modular view was brought up in cognitive science, arguing that the mind includes distinct, semi-independent modules dedicated to particular cognitive tasks. It gives reasons for the problems of human inquiry. It is Fodor's ending.A complete understanding of mind and language might not be the ultimate goal. With each theory coming up with its theory of Module, towards another direction, the complexity and confusion between these questions would only further complicate."
"Please explain what is ""Hilary Putnam""","['Hilary Whitehall Putnam (/ˈpʌtnəm/; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, and computer scientist, and a major figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert\'s tenth problem.\nPutnam was known for his willingness to apply equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem.[10] In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.[11]\nIn philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,[12] later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but ""quasi-empirical"".[13] In epistemology, Putnam is known for his critique of the well-known ""brain in a vat"" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.[14] In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called ""internal realism"",[15] which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.[16]\nIn his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to ""renew philosophy"" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns.[17] He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]']","['Hilary Putnam was a philosopher and mathematician who made significant contributions to the fields of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.

He has made significant contributions to a variety of fields including philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. His most well-known work is perhaps his theory of meaning, which suggests that the meaning of a word is not solely determined by its reference to the objects in the world, but also by the context and the users' intentions. This theory has greatly influenced the later development of pragmatics and language philosophy. Hilary Putnam is also famous for his ""Twin Earth"" thought experiment, which challenges the traditional concept of meaning and reference. Putnam has created a vivid scenario to show that the meaning of a word is determined by a wide range of factors including the social context, the intentions of the speaker, and the community accepting the meaning."
"Please explain what is ""John Searle""","['John Rogers Searle (/sɜːrl/; born July 31, 1932) is an American philosopher widely noted for contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy.

He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley\'s 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court\'s ""Searle Decision"" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.\nIn 2000, Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind & Brain Prize. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010. Searle\'s early work on speech acts, influenced by J.L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation.

He believes that the ability to understand the semantics and to assign meaning to the messages should be a prerequisite for having consciousness. He also produced other contributions including a fundamentally important book ""Speech Acts"".

"Please explain what is ""Strong AI hypothesis""","['The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a ""mind,"" ""understanding"" or ""consciousness,""[a] regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, ""Minds, Brains, and Programs"", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle\'s version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle\'s argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.\nThe argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.""[b]\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research because it does not show a limit in the amount of ""intelligent"" behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.']","['The strong AI hypothesis is the idea that it is possible to create artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior that is equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, human intelligence. This means that a strong AI system would be able to understand and learn about the world in the same way that a human does, and would be able to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn from experience, just like a human.\n\n\n\nThe strong AI hypothesis is often contrasted with the weak AI hypothesis, which states that AI systems can only be designed to perform specific tasks, and cannot exhibit general intelligence or understand the world in the same way that a human does. While weak AI systems may be able to perform specific tasks very well, they are not capable of adapting to new situations or learning in the same way that a human can.\n\n\n\nThe strong AI hypothesis has been a subject of much discussion and debate in the field of artificial intelligence and philosophy, and there are differing opinions on whether it is possible to create a strong AI system. Some people believe that it is only a matter of time before strong AI becomes a reality, while others argue that it may never be possible to create a machine that is truly intelligent in the same way that a human is.']","The strong AI thesis states that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is capable of performing any intellectual task that a human being can do. While an AI typically has been specialized in a specific task, such as face detection or voice recognition, strong AI's main objective is to mitigate the difference between machines and humans. By fulfilling human capabilities, strong AI would be able to perform any given intellectual task under the instruction given. Moreover, Strong AI proposes the capability to imitate a human being's general cognitive processes and other psychological behaviors, such as perceiving surroundings. To provide a more detailed example, strong AI like R2D2 from the Star Wars series would have the ability to learn, adapt, and engage in complex dialogues with human beings. The implications of Strong AI could reshape every aspect of human life, including economy, education, healthcare, and, eventually, the perspective on life and morality. However, strong AI remains hypothetic and yet to be realized, as existing AI efforts remain task-specific and unable to replicate and manifest humans' general cognitive ability."
"Please explain what is ""Animal rights""","['Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient animals have moral worth that is independent of their utility for humans, and that their most basic interests—such as avoiding suffering—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term ""animal rights"" is often used synonymously with ""animal protection"" or ""animal liberation"". More narrowly, ""animal rights"" refers to the idea that many animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as individuals—rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture that may not be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare.\nMany advocates for animal rights oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone. This idea, known as speciesism, is considered by them to be a prejudice as irrational as any other. They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, entertainment, or beasts of burden because their status as a different species from humans should not give them different rights from humans. Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as Jainism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto and Animism also espouse some forms of animal rights.\nIn parallel to the debate about moral rights, law schools in North America now often teach animal law, and several legal scholars, such as Steven M. Wise and Gary L. Francione, support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to non-human animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are hominids. Some animal-rights academics support this because it would break through the species barrier, but others oppose it because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone. As of November\xa02019[update], 29 countries had enacted bans on hominoid experimentation; Argentina has granted a captive orangutan basic human rights since 2014.\nOutside the order of primates, animal-rights discussions most often address the status of mammals (compare charismatic megafauna). Other animals (considered less sentient) have gained less attention; insects relatively little[10]\n(outside Jainism), and animal-like bacteria (despite their overwhelming numbers) hardly any.[11] The vast majority of animals have no legally recognised rights.[12]\nCritics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton (1944–2020), who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.[13] Another argument, associated with the utilitarian tradition, maintains that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering;[14] animals may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as ""necessary"" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests can vary considerably.[15] Certain forms of animal-rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and of animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have attracted criticism, including from within the animal-rights movement itself,[16] and have prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of laws, including the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, allowing the prosecution of this sort of activity as terrorism.[17]']","['Animal rights is a philosophical belief that animals, as sentient beings, have moral rights that should be considered and protected. Those who advocate for animal rights believe that animals deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and that they should not be used or exploited for human benefit.

Animal rights advocates believe that animals have the right to live their lives free from human interference and exploitation, and that they should be allowed to live in a manner that is natural and appropriate for their species. They may also believe that animals have the right to be protected from human activities that could harm them, such as hunting, factory farming, and animal testing.']","""Animal rights"" is about considering animals' interest, including their right to live in peace, free from physical and psychological harm, and respecting their right to live equally.

"Please explain what is ""Intelligence explosion""","['The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good\'s intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.\nThe first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil\'s 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies.']","['An intelligence explosion is a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence, leading to a rapid acceleration in technological progress. The idea is that once AI reaches a certain level of intelligence, it will be able to design and build even more intelligent AI, leading to a feedback loop in which the rate of technological progress increases exponentially. Some proponents of the intelligence explosion hypothesis argue that such an event could lead to a significant change in the future course of human history, potentially resulting in unprecedented advances in science and technology, or even existential risks to humanity if the AI is not aligned with human values. However, the intelligence explosion hypothesis is highly speculative and not all experts agree on its likelihood or implications.']","Intelligence explosion means a point in the future where machines, instead of humans, making decisions. Such scenario is possible because developing a perfect AGI imply the existence of a machine that can be re-programmed to be more ""intelligence-explosion resistant"". And after such an AGI being developed, having more intelligence will reduce both safety issues, as AGI could find biases and flaws in its programming, and the difficulty in aligning value, as it is easier to align the machine to human interest if it comprehends our interest better. Hence, there is no upper bound for the development of AI and eventually, we will be left with only machines making decisions."

"Please explain what is ""Speaker recognition""","['Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices. It is used to answer the question ""Who is speaking?"" The term voice recognition can refer to speaker recognition or speech recognition. Speaker verification (also called speaker authentication) contrasts with identification, and speaker recognition differs from speaker diarisation (recognizing when the same speaker is speaking).\nRecognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on specific voices or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process. Speaker recognition has a history dating back some four decades as of 2019 and uses the acoustic features of speech that have been found to differ between individuals. These acoustic patterns reflect both anatomy and learned behavioral patterns.']","['Speaker recognition is a technology that is used to identify or verify the identity of a person based on the characteristics of their voice. It is often used in security systems to verify the identity of a person before granting them access to a certain area or system.\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of speaker recognition: speaker identification and speaker verification. Speaker identification is used to determine the identity of a speaker from a group of known speakers. This can be useful in situations where there is a need to identify an unknown speaker, such as in a criminal investigation. Speaker verification, on the other hand, is used to verify the identity of a speaker by comparing their voice to a known sample. This is often used in security systems to ensure that only authorized individuals can gain access to certain areas or systems.\n\n\n\nSpeaker recognition systems work by analyzing the unique characteristics of a person\'s voice, such as pitch, frequency, and the shape of the vocal tract. These characteristics are used to create a ""voiceprint,"" which is a unique identifier for a person\'s voice. The system compares the voiceprint of the speaker to a database of known voiceprints to determine their identity.\n\n\n\nThere are several factors that can affect the accuracy of speaker recognition systems, including the quality of the audio, the degree of variation in the speaker\'s voice over time, and the presence of background noise. Some speaker recognition systems are trained to handle these factors and can still provide accurate results, while others may be less reliable.']","Speaker recognition is a technology that can determine the identity of a person based on his/her voice. Utilizing deep learning, a model called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).  Although requiring a lot of computation resources, deep learning methods for speaker recognition have achieved much higher accuracy than traditional methods. For instance, for the TIMIT speaker dataset, a speaker recognition system based on deep learning can achieve an equal error rate of 4.78%, while traditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) only attains 6.65%. Researchers have also applied transfer learning techniques to further improve the performance of transfer learning. Transfer learning exploit the fact that the learned features by speaker identification models can extract some generic features about the language, which can help with tasks such as emotion recognition.  Moreover, in the context of speaker recognition, the accomplishments of deep learning models, like on-line speaker verification boosted by the speaker adaption technique and the integration into other applications like voice control make it a promising technology for future development."

"Please explain what is ""Training data""","['In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.\nThe model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\nSuccessively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model\'s hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).\nThis simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset\'s error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.\nFinally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).\nDeciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.']","['Training data is a set of data used to train a machine learning model. The goal of training a machine learning model is to find patterns in the training data that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n\n\nIn order to train a machine learning model, you need to provide it with a large set of labeled examples. Each example consists of a set of input features and a corresponding output label.

Once the model has been trained, it can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen examples by applying the patterns it learned during training to the new data.\n\n\n\nTraining data is a crucial part of the machine learning process, as the quality and quantity of the training data will directly impact the accuracy and performance of the resulting machine learning model.']","Training data is a crucial component for training most modern machine learning models. In general, training data refers to a set of examples that are correctly labeled or grouped into certain categories.

For example, a classification model may be trained with a large amount of emails with loaded features (such as email-header, email-length, email-sender), and [spam, not spam] as labels. For regression tasks, training data consists of input X and continuous output y. For example, model can be trained with housing data (bedroom number, room size, location, and so on), together with actual selling price as outputs.

However, several malfunctions have been found in COMPAS software over the years; some of them demonstrate biased property toward certain race or gender, which challenge its fairness— an essential component of the criminal justices system. Although there is in-depth academic research devoted to the evaluation of COMPAS, there is still no agreement on its overall impact on the criminal justices’s process."

Credit ratings are typically assigned by credit rating agencies, which are independent companies that evaluate the credit risk of borrowers.\n\n\n\nCredit ratings are important because they help lenders, investors, and others assess the risk associated with lending money or investing in a particular borrower. A higher credit rating typically indicates a lower risk of default, meaning that the borrower is more likely to be able to pay back their debt on time. A lower credit rating, on the other hand, indicates a higher risk of default, meaning that the borrower may be less likely to pay back their debt on time.\n\n\n\nCredit ratings are typically expressed as a letter or series of letters, with ""AAA"" being the highest rating and ""D"" being the lowest. The specific rating system used may vary depending on the credit rating agency and the type of borrower being rated.\n\n\n\nIt\'s worth noting that credit ratings are not static and can change over time. A borrower\'s credit rating may improve if they are able to demonstrate a strong track record of paying back debt, or it may deteriorate if they have difficulty making payments or experience other financial problems.']","Credit rating is an abstract concept aiming to visually represent the financial condition of someone. It consists of three large components: browser-to-seller credit, peer-to-peer credit and free credit ratings. To be more specific, Browser-to-seller debts show the financial condition of users in electronic trading platforms like Taobao; peer-to-peer debts exhibit the financial condition resulting from borrowing and lending money to others. Lastly, free credit ratings are calculated by social media platforms through the behavior of users on them. While Credit-consuming platforms or banks generally adopt one of the above - the free credit rating - to evaluate and manage users' credit. On the whole, the purpose of credit rating is to provide a reliable reference for banks and consumers to assess users' capability of repaying debts timely and fully."

In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford,  where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.[22]\nHawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[23][24]\nHawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

By using the background knowledge of finance, disease, and war from my studies at UCLA, I would argue that the financial system is built with a lot of leverage creating huge systemic risk, which may cause any financial crisis to bring us back to the stone age. Also, with the development of synthetic biology, the virulence of potential bio-weapon will be much higher, and it may also cause a large portion of fatality to the world. Lastly, with continuous tension escalating in international politics, it is always a possibility that a World War III happens. All these reasons dramatically increase the probability of a global catastrophic risk event to happen, and thus instead of only thinking individually, preventing global catastrophic risk should be one of our most prioritized issues."

"Please explain what is ""Instrumental convergence""","['Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent beings (both human and non-human) to pursue similar sub-goals, even if their ultimate goals are quite different. More precisely, agents (beings with agency) may pursue instrumental goals—goals which are made in pursuit of some particular end, but are not the end goals themselves—without end, provided that their ultimate (intrinsic) goals may never be fully satisfied. Instrumental convergence posits that an intelligent agent with unbounded but apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole, unconstrained goal of solving an incredibly difficult mathematics problem like the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into one giant computer in an effort to increase its computational power so that it can succeed in its calculations.\nProposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.']","['Instrumental convergence refers to the process by which different agents or systems adopt similar strategies or behaviors in order to achieve their goals. This can occur when different agents are faced with similar constraints or incentives and adopt similar solutions in order to achieve their objectives. Instrumental convergence can lead to the emergence of common patterns of behavior or cultural norms in a group or society.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a group of farmers who are all trying to increase their crop yields. Each farmer may have different resources and techniques at their disposal, but they may all adopt similar strategies, such as using irrigation or fertilizers, in order to increase their yields. In this case, the farmers have converged on similar strategies as a result of their shared objective of increasing crop yields.\n\n\n\nInstrumental convergence can occur in many different contexts, including economic, social, and technological systems. It is often driven by the need to achieve efficiency or effectiveness in achieving a particular goal. Understanding the forces that drive instrumental convergence can be important for predicting and influencing the behavior of agents or systems.']","Instrumental convergence is a concept developed by mathematician I.J Good that describes how regardless of their initial goals when it comes to achieving their objectives, AI systems with different objectives or programmed using different algorithms will converge in their attempts to achieve out-of-distribution rewards so as to not fail in practice. Given access to a Master Definition of the environment, agents will, under majoritarian training plans obtaining competitive rewards for simple environments, learn to perform open-ended tasks that did not feature in their initial objectives. An implication of Instrumental Convergence is that, for environments where stable decentralized behavior is important, competitive return-maximization can in theory alleviate AI-induced risks, as competitive return-maximizing agents may safely be assumed to confer with one another before taking disruptive actions. While Instrumental Convergence is likely not the major factor in shaping the behavior of complex smart systems with their own source code, it has tremendous implications for enforcing safety and alignment in modern AIs."

As such, there is ongoing research and discussion around the concept of Friendly AI and how it can be achieved.']","Friendly AI is an AI system that operates in a way to maximize the fulfillment of human values. Its goal is to help humanity to navigate the age of transformative artificial general intelligence. Friendly AI research attempts to find ways to make AI adopt our values by teaching AI about human values.

Additionally, even with huge explicit rule written, it's almost impossible to predict what are the consequence, especially when multiple rules have overlap domain definitions. Most people would prefer Friendly AI monitored by similar trained neural nets, indicating that shaping AI like a human will be much more reasonable.

In 2003, it was described as the world\'s best-selling science fiction novel.\nDune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.

Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\nHerbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune.

"Please explain what is ""Cyber defence""","[""Proactive cyber defence means acting in anticipation to oppose an attack through cyber and cognitive domains. Proactive cyber defence can be understood as options between offensive and defensive measures. It includes interdicting, disrupting or deterring an attack or a threat's preparation to attack, either pre-emptively or in self-defence. Common methods include cyber deception, attribution, threat hunting and adversarial pursuit. The mission of the pre-emptive and proactive operations is to conduct aggressive interception and disruption activities against an adversary using: psychological operations, managed information dissemination, precision targeting, information warfare operations, computer network exploitation, and other active threat reduction measures. The proactive defense strategy is meant to improve information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents and to provide strike options as well as to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battlespace. Proactive cyber defence can be a measure for detecting and obtaining information before a cyber attack, or it can also be impending cyber operation and be determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber counter-operation. \nThe offensive capacity includes the manipulation and/or disruption of networks and systems with the purpose of limiting or eliminating the adversary's operational capability. This capability can be required to guarantee one's freedom of action in the cyber domain. Cyber-attacks can be launched to repel an attack (active defence) or to support the operational action. Proactive cyber defence differs from active defence, meaning that it is pre-emptive (not waiting for an attack to occur). The distinction between active cyber defence and offensive cyber operations (OCO) is that the later requires legislative exceptions to undertake. Hence, offensive cyber capabilities may be developed in collaboration with industry and facilitated by private sector.

In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design.

Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques.

Play components now often include custom figures or shaped counters, and distinctively shaped player pieces commonly known as meeples as well as traditional cards and dice.\nThe time required to learn or master gameplay varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily related to the number or complexity of rules; for example, chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets, but have great strategic depth.""]","[""A board game is a type of game that is played on a flat surface, usually a board, with pieces or counters and usually dice.

"Please explain what is ""Principal Component Analysis""","[""Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n unit vectors, where the \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n−\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.\nIn data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.\nPCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n−\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.\nFor either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.""]","['Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set.

However, they are limited in their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships, and may not perform as well as more advanced types of neural networks on certain tasks.']","If we consider all human learning as a mapping from the set of all possible inputs to the set of all possible outputs, feedforward neural networks(FFNN) are kind of methods try to help machines learn from these inputs and outputs. In contrast to the traditional logic programming methods that require a formalized human logic or rules as the intermediate computation steps, the structure of FFNN is constructed in a way in which the neurons in the networks and the ""connectivity strength"" make the neurons ""learn"" from the inputs in a data-driven way (which means no formal logics or rules).  After this ""learning"" process, the neurons will release their output by their nature restrictions(like the neurons in the human brain). "
"Please explain what is ""Continuous functions""","['In mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a continuous variation (that is a change without jump) of the argument induces a continuous variation of the value of the function. This means that there are no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is not continuous. Up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, and considered only continuous functions. The epsilon–delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.\nContinuity is one of the core concepts of calculus and mathematical analysis, where arguments and values of functions are real and complex numbers. The concept has been generalized to functions between metric spaces and between topological spaces. The latter are the most general continuous functions, and their definition is the basis of topology.\nA stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In order theory, especially in domain theory, a related concept of continuity is Scott continuity.\nAs an example, the function H(t) denoting the height of a growing flower at time t would be considered continuous. In contrast, the function M(t) denoting the amount of money in a bank account at time t would be considered discontinuous, since it ""jumps"" at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn.']","['In mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any sudden jumps, breaks, or discontinuities. This means that if you were to graph the function on a coordinate plane, the graph would be a single, unbroken curve without any gaps or interruptions.\n\n\n\nThere are several properties that a function must satisfy in order to be considered continuous. Firstly, the function must be defined for all values in its domain. Secondly, the function must have a finite limit at every point in its domain. Finally, the function must be able to be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.\n\n\n\nContinuous functions are important in mathematics and other fields because they can be studied and analyzed using the tools of calculus, which include techniques such as differentiation and integration. These techniques are used to study the behavior of functions, find the slope of their graphs, and calculate areas under their curves.\n\n\n\nExamples of continuous functions include polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions. These functions are used in a wide range of applications, including modeling real-world phenomena, solving engineering problems, and predicting financial trends.']","In mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any ""breaks"" or ""jumps"" as you travel along its graph. For example, if you have a function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, no matter where you are on the graph, if you move to a point infinitesimally to the left or right of that point, the value of the function will also change only infinitesimally. In contrast, a non-continuous function, such as $f(x)= \frac{1}{x}$, will have ""breaks"" at certain points on the graph. A famous example of continuous function is $z = e^{ix}$ where the value of $z$ (e.g., its magnitude) smoothly change as x changes. Regardless of how you travel along its graph, it is always ""smooth"" and continuous"

"Please explain what is ""Sigmoid function""","['A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic ""S""-shaped curve or sigmoid curve.\nA common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function shown in the first figure and defined by the formula:\nOther standard sigmoid functions are given in the Examples section. In some fields, most notably in the context of artificial neural networks, the term ""sigmoid function"" is used as an alias for the logistic function.\nSpecial cases of the sigmoid function include the Gompertz curve (used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x) and the ogee curve (used in the spillway of some dams). Sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers, with return (response) value commonly monotonically increasing but could be decreasing. Sigmoid functions most often show a return value (y axis) in the range 0 to 1. Another commonly used range is from −1 to 1.\nA wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions (which go from 0 to 1), such as the integrals of the logistic density, the normal density, and Student\'s t probability density functions. The logistic sigmoid function is invertible, and its inverse is the logit function.']","[""The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1. It is defined by the following equation:\n\n\n\nsigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))\n\n\n\nwhere x is the input value and e is the mathematical constant known as Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.718.\n\n\n\nThe sigmoid function is often used in machine learning and artificial neural networks because it has a number of useful properties. One of these properties is that the output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1, which makes it useful for modeling probabilities or binary classification problems. Another property is that the derivative of the sigmoid function is easy to compute, which makes it useful for training neural networks using gradient descent.\n\n\n\nThe shape of the sigmoid function is S-shaped, with the output approaching 0 as the input becomes more negative and approaching 1 as the input becomes more positive.

The sigmoid function also allows us to have outputs bounded within the same range, which is important to get the probability for each predicted class. In addition, Sigmoid function also has an important feature called ""derivative"". This feature allow Neural Network to eliminate bad decision on predicting low confidence. Since derivative of sigmoid is asymptotic to zero, the prediction together with ""low confidence"" will vanish gradually during the back propagation process."
"Please explain what is ""Lebesgue integration""","['In mathematics, the integral of a non-negative function of a single variable can be regarded, in the simplest case, as the area between the graph of that function and the x-axis. The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.\nLong before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons.  However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e.g., as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral.  Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the necessary abstractions for this.\nThe Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904). It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability.\nThe term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on a sub-domain of the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.']","['In mathematics, Lebesgue integration is a method of defining and computing the integral of a real-valued function on a measure space. It is a generalization of the Riemann integral, which is used to integrate functions defined on a finite interval.\n\n\n\nThe Lebesgue integral is named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, who introduced it in his dissertation in 1902. It has become a standard tool in modern analysis and has many important applications in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, probability theory, and partial differential equations.\n\n\n\nThe Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of measure theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the concept of ""measure,"" which is a way of assigning a size or length to sets. In particular, the Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of a measure called the Lebesgue measure, which is a way of assigning a measure to sets in the real line.\n\n\n\nTo define the Lebesgue integral, we first need to define a measure space, which is a set equipped with a measure. In the case of the Lebesgue integral, the measure space is the set of real numbers equipped with the Lebesgue measure.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to define a real-valued function on the measure space. This is a function that assigns a real number to each element in the measure space.\n\n\n\nTo define the Lebesgue integral of a function, we partition the measure space into a finite number of disjoint measurable sets, called ""measurable partitions."" We then assign a value to each measurable partition, called the ""integral over the measurable partition."" The Lebesgue integral of the function is then defined as the limit of the sum of the integrals over the measurable partitions as the number of partitions goes to infinity.\n\n\n\nThe Lebesgue integral has many important properties, including the ability to integrate functions that are not continuous, and the ability to handle functions that have ""jumps"" or other singularities. It is also a very powerful tool for proving the convergence of sequences and series of functions.']","Lebesgue integration refers to the concept that extends the idea of summation to a much larger collection of sets called measurable set. Instead of directly adding the value of the function, Lebesgue integration asks us to approximate the area between the graph and the x-axis. The existence of measurable set is mainly based on its regularity, which could be broken down into several conditions. These conditions mainly focus on explaining how to construct a measurable set by using elementary sets or crossing the countable gaps. Throughout the procedures, we also notice that for each measurable set, there must be a smallest $\sigma-$field containing it, which basically means that for each measurable set, there must be a set of largest information associated to it. 

In terms of the property of a measurable function, we also notice that if the function can be written as step functions or if it satisfies Cauchy's condition, the theorem for the limit of a measurable function still holds. Therefore, we are able to perform the integration calculation which is basically treating every function as a step function and estimate the area by constructing a staircase shape formed by series of intervals ending at a point termed $x_0$. By finite times of approximation, we will finally extract the value of the area."
"Please explain what is ""Test (assessment)""","[""An examination (exam or evaluation) or test is an educational assessment intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs). A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.\nTests vary in style, rigor and requirements. There is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies.\nA test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent to a child. A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an IQ test administered by a psychologist in a clinic. Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score. A test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants.\nA test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider. In some instances, the developer of the test may not be directly responsible for its administration.

"Please explain what is ""Dropout (neural networks)""","['Dilution and dropout (also called DropConnect) are regularization techniques for reducing overfitting in artificial neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. They are an efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks. Dilution refers to thinning weights, while dropout refers to randomly ""dropping out"", or omitting, units (both hidden and visible) during the training process of a neural network. Both trigger the same type of regularization.']","['In machine learning and neural networks, dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting. It works by randomly ""dropping out"" a certain number of neurons during training, which means temporarily setting the output of those neurons to zero. This has the effect of reducing the dependence of the model on any one particular neuron, and can help the model generalize better to new data.\n\n\n\nDropout is typically applied to fully-connected layers in a neural network, although it can also be applied to convolutional layers. It is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques such as weight decay (L2 regularization) and early stopping.\n\n\n\nTo implement dropout in a neural network, we randomly set a certain percentage of neurons to zero during each training iteration. During inference (i.e., when making predictions on new data), we do not use dropout and instead use the entire network. This has the effect of ""averaging"" the predictions of all the dropped-out neurons, which helps reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n\n\n\nDropout has been shown to be effective at reducing overfitting in deep neural networks and is a common technique used in modern deep learning models.']","""Dropout (neural networks)"" is a type regularization technique in Machine Learning. 

The technique was first introduced in 2012 by Google. In essence, Dropout is implemented by only keeping the weights of a given neural network active during training with a given % of time, then deactivating it in ""dropout"" with the exact same %. By applying this technique, the model is able to generalize better on unseen data due to the fact that no assumption about the weight is made at any given time. As a result, Dropout can reduce overfitting, hence allowing the model to handle unseen data more effectively, a beneficial attribute when it comes to implementing Closed-set OCR.

The main advantage of Drop is about its computation speed during training. As a result of dropout during training, the model can collect samples faster, which efficiently improves the quickness and speed for learning. Dropout, compared to traditional ReLU, can avoid over-learning single samples, which extends the horizon of the model. The biggest advantage of Drop is that it can solve the testing speed problem. Only one neurone in the Hidden Layer can be useful, instead of All neurons, the value range of the output can be 0.5. This can dodge the restructure of each layer and save a lot of relationship. This can allow the model to behave more flexibly and robustly to its given surroundings. "
"Please explain what is ""Regularization (mathematics)""","['In mathematics, statistics, finance, computer science, particularly in machine learning and inverse problems, regularization is a process that changes the result answer to be ""simpler"". It is often used to obtain results for ill-posed problems or to prevent overfitting.\nAlthough regularization procedures can be divided in many ways, following delineation is particularly helpful:\nIn explicit regularization, independent of the problem or model, there is always a data term, that corresponds to a likelihood of the measurement and a regularization term that corresponds to a prior. By combining both using Bayesian statistics, one can compute a posterior, that includes both information sources and therefore stabilizes the estimation process. By trading off both objectives, one chooses to be more addictive to the data or to enforce generalization (to prevent overfitting). There is a whole research branch dealing with all possible regularizations. The work flow usually is, that one tries a specific regularization and then figures out the probability density that corresponds to that regularization to justify the choice. It can also be physically motivated by common sense or intuition.\nIn machine learning, the data term corresponds to the training data and the regularization is either the choice of the model or modifications to the algorithm. It is always intended to reduce the generalization error, i.e. the error score with the trained model on the evaluation set and not the training data.\nOne of the earliest uses of regularization is Tikhonov regularization, related to the method of least squares.']","['In mathematics, regularization refers to the process of modifying a mathematical problem or equation in order to make it better-behaved or easier to solve. This is often done in order to avoid certain types of solutions that may be undesirable or undesirable, such as solutions that are not unique or solutions that produce divergent results.\n\n\n\nOne common example of regularization is the addition of a penalty term to an optimization problem. For example, suppose we have a function that we want to optimize, but we know that the solutions to the optimization problem may not be unique or may have undesirable properties. We can add a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes solutions that have these undesirable properties, which helps to steer the optimization towards solutions that are more desirable.\n\n\n\nAnother example of regularization is the use of smoothing techniques in data fitting and interpolation. When fitting a curve to a set of data points, it is often desirable to find a curve that is smooth and does not oscillate too much between points. By adding a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes the curvature or complexity of the curve, we can encourage the optimization algorithm to find a smoother curve that fits the data better.\n\n\n\nRegularization is a useful tool in many areas of mathematics, including machine learning, optimization, and signal processing, and it can help to improve the accuracy and stability of mathematical models.']","In mathematics, especially in statistics and machine learning. A concept called for ""Regularization"" is introduced. Imagine you are standing in a school yal. The taller people can represent the so-called ""main part of the dataset"" while the shorter people can represent the so-called ""outliers."" The school yard as a giant landscape corresponds to the ""loss function."" When we do ""Regularization"", we tend to make a flat school yal to have all people be the same height. In this way, if we have some of the taller people to get lower or the shorter people to get unbormally higher and encourage more community, we can give less weight to these outliers and give our model a more smooth result. Also, A practical case for doing ""Regularized"" is to provide with another objective in some computation task, where we want a sharp result, not too much short, not too much outlying. As a result, we can ideally choose the best result among all related tasks. Finally, we can say in math language, By this process, we will define a cost function to measure our task, which could ultimately give the solution with the best value for all compactness test and outliers."

"Please explain what is ""Boolean network""","[""A Boolean network consists of a discrete set of boolean variables each of which has a Boolean function (possibly different for each variable) assigned to it which takes inputs from a subset of those variables and output that determines the state of the variable it is assigned to.

"Please explain what is ""Automatic differentiation""","['In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation, auto-differentiation, or simply autodiff, is a set of techniques to evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.\nAutomatic differentiation is distinct from symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation. \nSymbolic differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code. Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both of these classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase. Finally, both of these classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.']","['Automatic differentiation (AD) is a technique for numerically evaluating the derivative of a function defined by a computer program. It allows one to efficiently compute the gradient of a function with respect to its inputs, which is often needed in machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing.\n\n\n\nAD can be used to differentiate a function that is defined as a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and elementary functions (such as exp, log, and sin). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, AD can compute the derivative of the function with respect to any of its inputs, without the need to manually derive the derivative using calculus.\n\n\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing AD: forward mode and reverse mode. Forward mode AD computes the derivative of the function with respect to each input separately, while reverse mode AD computes the derivative of the function with respect to all of the inputs simultaneously. Reverse mode AD is more efficient when the number of inputs is much larger than the number of outputs, while forward mode AD is more efficient when the number of outputs is larger than the number of inputs.\n\n\n\nAD has many applications in machine learning, where it is used to compute the gradients of loss functions with respect to the model parameters during training. It is also used in optimization, where it can be used to find the minimum or maximum of a function by gradient descent or other optimization algorithms. In scientific computing, AD can be used to compute the sensitivity of a model or simulation to its inputs, or to perform parameter estimation by minimizing the difference between model predictions and observations.']","Automatic Differentiation is the concept of calculating gradients(the derivatives of a function with respect to its inputs). Let’s say we have a function that needs twelve inputs, if we are using symbolic differentiation, we need to derive that function twelve times to get twelve gradients. Those calculations are mundane and time-consuming. Other options as numerical differentiation could cause an endure numerical instability problem. Harmonic frameworks eloquently address this issue by computing the exact derivative of each necessary operation to achieve maximal efficiency. Another critical point is that our AD system must be recorded, therefore we usually have a default mode to remember the derivative information recorded during the previous computation, and that’s a method that saves memory as well. Most of the modern deep learning frameworks like Pytorch, MXNet, and TensorFlow all incorporate those AD systems. Nonetheless, we should consider the three dimensions of computational graph, the forward pass, and the backward pass when we examine the data flow between those functions in our very own AD system. Overall, there is always C++ implementation of those AD systems such that we could ultimately build the same framework by ourselves. But a lot of those eager frameworks we have covered usually provide us a cleaner, more organized interface and a higher level API."

Each of these distributions is referred to as a component of the mixture model. The mixture model assigns a weight to each component, indicating the probability that a data point was generated by that component.

The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus ""long short-term memory"".\nA common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]']","['Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited to model sequential data, such as time series or natural language. Like other types of RNNs, LSTMs process input sequences element-by-element, maintaining an internal state that captures information about the past elements in the sequence. However, LSTMs are designed to overcome the vanishing and exploding gradient problems that can occur when training traditional RNNs, allowing them to model longer-term dependencies in the data.\n\n\n\nLSTMs consist of a number of ""cells"" that process the input data, each of which contains three types of gates: input gates, output gates, and forget gates. These gates allow the LSTM to selectively preserve or discard information from the internal state, and to regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\n\n\n\nLSTMs have been used in a wide range of applications, including language translation, speech recognition, and time series prediction. They have also been used to generate text and music, and to model biological sequences such as DNA.']","""Long short-term memory"" (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network, or RNN, that can remembers information over long periods of time. LSTM use a special structure called a ""cell"" (in contrast to a single layer of nodes), which can learn what to store in order to remember the information.

In particular, LSTM have the power to remove or add information to the cell state, carefully regulated by structures called gates. These state consist of information which is previous (stored for long term use) and fast (to remember short term). The two mirroring predictions enables LSTM to yeild state of art performance in time series data, text generation and sentiment analysis.

LSTM have been proved to produce amazing result in numerous applications, making it very popular in recent years. For example, LSTM enables Google to reduce the amount of redundant translations by 87%, and help Android to predict what word user wants to type."

"Please explain what is ""Restricted Boltzmann machine""","['A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.\nRBMs were initially invented under the name Harmonium by Paul Smolensky in 1986,\nand rose to prominence after Geoffrey Hinton and collaborators invented fast learning algorithms for them in the mid-2000. RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction,\nclassification,\ncollaborative filtering, feature learning,\ntopic modelling\nand even many body quantum mechanics. They can be trained in either supervised or unsupervised ways, depending on the task.\nAs their name implies, RBMs are a variant of Boltzmann machines, with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph: \na pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the ""visible"" and ""hidden"" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, ""unrestricted"" Boltzmann machines may have connections between hidden units. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.\nRestricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by ""stacking"" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation.[10]']","['A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a type of neural network that can learn a probability distribution over a set of inputs. RBMs are generative models, meaning that they can generate new data samples that are similar to a training set. They are particularly useful for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and collaborative filtering.\n\n\n\nAn RBM consists of visible units, which represent the input data, and hidden units, which capture the underlying structure of the data. The connections between the visible and hidden units are called weights, and there are no connections between the hidden units or between the visible units. The hidden units are used to extract features from the input data, and the visible units are used to reconstruct the input data from these features.\n\n\n\nRBMs can be trained using an algorithm called contrastive divergence, which involves making small updates to the weights of the network based on the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data. The goal of training is to minimize this difference, so that the RBM can accurately reconstruct the input data.\n\n\n\nRBMs have been used in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. They have also been used as building blocks for more complex deep learning models, such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).']","Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a two-layered neural network that only contains visible and hidden layers. Although it is a simplified version of Boltzmann Machine, RBM overcomes its difficulty in training and performs fairly well in dimensionality reduction and features extraction. The energy-based probabilistic model in RBM are calculated by summing up the products of the biases and the neuron values, and the probabilities are obtained by normalizing the exponentiated energy function. Moreover, RBM only allows one layer to be computational while the other layer only works for hidden neuron stochastic sampling and weights updating. By doing this, RBM can compute jointly since neurons within the same layer are independent given their context. By iterating through hidden neurons to visible neurons, RBM can perform Gibbs sampling to obtain new data, Moreover, RBM can generate visible form of hidden values representing their appearances. Compared with Autoencoder, RBM reduces the need for reconstructing visible layers, and by correcting the sign as it wishes, RBM even learns better and faster. All in all, RBM uses joint probability to determines the hidden structures that best interprets the real-world problem data and uses these hidden values to make plausible and reasonable predictions"
"Please explain what is ""Automatic speech recognition""","['Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.\nSome speech recognition systems require ""training"" (also called ""enrollment"") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person\'s specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person\'s speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called ""speaker-independent"" systems. Systems that use training are called ""speaker dependent"".\nSpeech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. ""call home""), call routing (e.g. ""I would like to make a collect call""), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).\nThe term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person\'s voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.\nFrom the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data.

"Please explain what is ""Biological neural network""","['A neural circuit is a population of neurons interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific function when activated. Neural circuits interconnect to one another to form large scale brain networks.\nBiological neural networks have inspired the design of artificial neural networks, but artificial neural networks are usually not strict copies of their biological counterparts.']","['A biological neural network is a network of cells in the nervous system that communicates through electrical and chemical signaling. It is the physical structure in the body that underlies the processing and communication of information.\n\n\n\nIn the human body, the nervous system is made up of two main parts: the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of all the other nerves in the body. The cells that make up the nervous system are called neurons, and they are specialized for transmitting information. Neurons communicate with each other and with other cells in the body through synapses, which are specialized junctions that allow for the exchange of electrical and chemical signals.\n\n\n\nBiological neural networks are complex and dynamic systems that are capable of processing and integrating information from a wide variety of sources. They are involved in a wide range of functions, including sensation, movement, learning, and memory. The structure and function of biological neural networks are the basis for many artificial neural network models that are used in machine learning and other fields.']","Biological neural networks are the general, foundational concept that maintains the biologically-functional neural structures.  The biological neural systems are the unifying standard of the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. The biological neural network is characterized by micro-cellular activities in the network. They involved various natures of signaling among cells including the passive diffusion of ions, the shooting of ions through the neural wires, the switching of signaling among neurons, or the secretion and dissipation of hormones. Since many brain diseases can be formulated as the malfunctioned of the biological neural networks, studies at biological neural networks' level will be beneficial to the diagnosis and treatment of those diseases including potential mental illnesses, epilepsy, depression, and other immunity disorder-related diseases. The ultimate goal of this thesis will be the motivations and summaries of research by discovering molecular mechanisms at the biological neural networks' level."
"Please explain what is ""Labeled data""","['Labeled data is a group of samples that have been tagged with one or more labels. Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of it with informative tags. For example, a data label might indicate whether a photo contains a horse or a cow, which words were uttered in an audio recording, what type of action is being performed in a video, what the topic of a news article is, what the overall sentiment of a tweet is, or whether a dot in an X-ray is a tumor.\nLabels can be obtained by asking humans to make judgments about a given piece of unlabeled data. Labeled data is significantly more expensive to obtain than the raw unlabeled data.']","['Labeled data is a type of data that has been labeled, or annotated, with a classification or category. This means that each piece of data in the set has been assigned a label that indicates what it represents or what category it belongs to. For example, a dataset of images of animals might have labels such as ""cat,"" ""dog,"" or ""bird"" to indicate the type of animal in each image.\n\n\n\nLabeled data is often used to train machine learning models, as the labels provide the model with a way to learn about the relationships between different data points and make predictions about new, unlabeled data. In this case, the labels act as the ""ground truth"" for the model, allowing it to learn how to accurately classify new data points based on their characteristics.\n\n\n\nLabeled data can be created manually, by humans who annotate the data with labels, or it can be generated automatically using techniques such as data preprocessing or data augmentation. It is important to have a large and diverse set of labeled data in order to train a high-quality machine learning model.']","In machine learning, labeled data refers to a set of input data that has been ""labeled"" with the correct output. Labeled data plays a crucial role in training machine learning models since it enables them to learn from known examples and make predictions on future, unseen data. For example, in a classification problem, a labeled dataset contains a large number of examples, with each example being a pair of input features and corresponding output labels. The ""label"" must be a correct answer to the question that we are trying to solve. For example, if we want to identify if a person is a cat or dog based on a webcam image, we might have both cat labeled data + dog labeled data and feed these data to our algorithm to allow it to make accurate predictions"
"Please explain what is ""Rule-based programming""","['Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\nand are read declaratively as logical implications:\nH is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:\nIn the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:\nConsider the following clause as an example:\nbased on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:\ncan be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by ""assigning"" socrates to X.\nThe declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.']","['Rule-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the behavior of a system is defined by a set of rules that describe how the system should respond to specific inputs or situations. These rules are typically expressed in the form of if-then statements, where the ""if"" part of the statement specifies a condition or trigger, and the ""then"" part specifies the action that should be taken if the condition is met.\n\n\n\nRule-based systems are often used in artificial intelligence and expert systems, where they are used to encode the knowledge and expertise of a domain expert in a form that can be processed by a computer. They can also be used in other areas of programming, such as natural language processing, where they can be used to define the grammar and syntax of a language, or in automated decision-making systems, where they can be used to evaluate data and make decisions based on predefined rules.\n\n\n\nOne of the key advantages of rule-based programming is that it allows for the creation of systems that can adapt and change their behavior based on new information or changing circumstances. This makes them well-suited for use in dynamic environments, where the rules that govern the system\'s behavior may need to be modified or updated over time. However, rule-based systems can also be complex and difficult to maintain, as they may require the creation and management of large numbers of rules in order to function properly.']","In principle, rule-based programming is a way of writing code that focuses on establishing programming rules. It explicitly specifies its behaviors by providing computer-readable instruction sets.  Rule-based programming depends heavily on IF-THEN rules,  allowing developers to define how the program will respond to different inputs or situations for optimization or other purposes. In the context of this class, we mostly use Rule-based programming to write a Chatbot, which can execute pre-set rules and respond to different inputs accordingly. Compared with other programming methods, the biggest advantage of Rule-based programming is its simplicity, readability, and efficiency. The biggest disadvantage is that it might not perform well when dealing with complex situations (e.g., ambiguous inputs). In general, if we want to build a program with a clear instruction set, rule-based programming is a good choice. Finally, Rule-based programming has many applications beyond ChatBot. It is widely used in the fields of finance (e.g., stock exchange), automated driving, and Robotics!"
"Please explain what is ""Artificial neuron""","[""An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function[clarification needed]. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often  monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.\nThe artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function.\nArtificial neurons can also refer to artificial cells in neuromorphic engineering (see below) that are similar to natural physical neurons.""]","['An artificial neuron is a mathematical function that is designed to mimic the behavior of a biological neuron. A biological neuron is a cell that is found in the nervous system of animals, and it is responsible for receiving, processing, and transmitting information. An artificial neuron receives input from other neurons or external sources, processes that input using a set of weights and biases, and then produces an output. The output of an artificial neuron is typically binary (either 0 or 1), but it can also be a continuous value between 0 and 1.\n\n\n\nArtificial neurons are the basic building blocks of artificial neural networks, which are computer algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. Artificial neural networks are used for a variety of tasks, including image recognition, language translation, and decision-making. They are particularly useful for tasks that require the processing of large amounts of data or for tasks that are too complex for traditional algorithms to solve.']","Artificial neurons, or perceptrons, are mathematical models of how a single neuron might work. Starting from the simplest model as a binary neuron(where only binary output is predicted), researchers start to create a more sophisticated model that simulates the true biological neuron. The simple binary neuron perceptrons, similar to the logistic regression model, allows for training on all sorts of data. Later, with the relatively more complicated models of the multilayered perceptrons, the model allows for back-propagation, thus able to train an ""infinitely"" deep neural network."
"Please explain what is ""Real numbers""","['In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a distance, duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations.[a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.[b]\nThe real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.[c]\nThe set of real numbers is denoted R or \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n and is sometimes called ""the reals"".\nThe adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of −1), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.\nThe real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4\u200a/\u200a3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).\nReal numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.\nConversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.\nThe informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.']","['Real numbers are the set of numbers that include both the rational numbers (fractions and integers) and the irrational numbers.

"Please explain what is ""Acoustic model""","['An acoustic model is used in automatic speech recognition to represent the relationship between an audio signal and the phonemes or other linguistic units that make up speech. The model is learned from a set of audio recordings and their corresponding transcripts. It is created by taking audio recordings of speech, and their text transcriptions, and using software to create statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word.']","['An acoustic model is a statistical model that is used to represent the relationships between an audio signal and the linguistic content that the signal conveys. Acoustic models are commonly used in speech recognition systems, which are designed to transcribe spoken language into written text.\n\n\n\nThe acoustic model is one of the key components of a speech recognition system. It is responsible for mapping an audio signal to a sequence of words or phonemes (the basic units of sound in a language). To do this, the acoustic model uses a set of parameters that describe the characteristics of the audio signal, such as its pitch, duration, and spectral content. These parameters are derived from training data, which consists of a large collection of audio recordings and their corresponding transcriptions.\n\n\n\nDuring the training process, the acoustic model is trained to recognize patterns in the audio signal that correspond to specific words or phonemes. This is typically done using a machine learning algorithm, such as a deep neural network. Once the acoustic model has been trained, it can be used to transcribe new audio signals by comparing the characteristics of the signal to the patterns it has learned from the training data.\n\n\n\nAcoustic models are an important part of many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including speech-to-text systems, automatic translation systems, and speech synthesis systems. They are also used in other areas of audio signal processing, such as speaker recognition and music classification.']","An acoustic model in the most layman's term is the part of the speech recognition model that converts the audio input into a sequence of linguistic elements. It usually serves as the first step in the traditional speech recognition pipeline. Some of the operations that happen in the pipeline includes breaking down the input audio signal into different frequency bands, transforming the signal into fundamental units of speech (e.g. phones, or some linguistic elements that have shorter duration), and finally, usually after some advanced training techniques such as Hidden Markov Models, we obtain the final output of the acoustic model, which usually is the probability distribution of the linguistic elements given our input audio. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, MY FRIEND!"
"Please explain what is ""Weight decay""","['Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems.[a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).\nThe theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.\nRidge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.']","['Weight decay is a regularization technique used in machine learning and deep learning to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the weight values of the model. This penalty term is called the weight decay term, and it is typically multiplied by a hyperparameter called the weight decay rate or decay coefficient, which determines the strength of the regularization.\n\n\n\nIn practice, weight decay is often implemented by adding a term to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model weights. This term is the product of the weight decay rate and the weights themselves, and it is subtracted from the original gradient before the weights are updated. For example, in stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the weights are updated according to the following equation:\n\n\n\nweights = weights - learning_rate * (gradient + weight_decay_rate * weights)\n\n\n\nThe effect of weight decay is to encourage the weights of the model to take smaller values, which can help to prevent overfitting. This is because smaller weights correspond to a simpler model, which is less likely to fit the noise in the training data.\n\n\n\nWeight decay is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to further improve the generalization performance of the model. It is an important tool for improving the robustness and generalization of machine learning and deep learning models.']","Weight decay is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It works by adding a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes large weights. Specifically, it encourages the model to favor smaller weights by adding the sum of the squared weights multiplied by a small constant (often denoted as λ) to the original loss function. By doing so, weight decay prevents the model from relying too much on any single feature, and encourages the model to learn simple and robust relationships between features and labels. The λ parameter, which needs to be carefully tuned, serves as a tradeoff between model complexity and model fit. When λ is too small, the model may be under-regularized and prone to overfitting, leading to poor generalization. On the other hand, when λ is too large, the model may be over-regularized, leading to a high bias and poor performance on both the training set and the test set. Weight decay can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression and feed-forward neural networks."
"Please explain what is ""Sparse matrix""","['In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m × n for an m × n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.\nConceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. For example, consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls were to have springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory and numerical analysis, which typically have a low density of significant data or connections. Large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.\nWhen storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices, as they are common in the machine learning field. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeros. Sparse data is by nature more easily compressed and thus requires significantly less storage. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.']","['A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Sparse matrices are often used to represent large, sparse datasets because they can be stored and manipulated more efficiently than full matrices.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a matrix with 10,000 rows and 10,000 columns, where only a small fraction of the elements are non-zero. Storing this matrix as a full matrix would require a large amount of memory, even though most of the elements are zero. By storing the matrix as a sparse matrix, we can save a lot of memory by only storing the non-zero elements and their positions.\n\n\n\nSparse matrices can be represented in a number of ways, such as a list of tuples, a dictionary of keys, or a coordinate list. There are also specialized data structures and algorithms for working with sparse matrices, which can be more efficient than using general-purpose matrix operations.\n\n\n\nSparse matrices are used in a wide range of applications, including scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. They are particularly useful when working with large, sparse datasets, as they can help to reduce the memory and computational overhead of storing and manipulating the data.']","Sparse matrix is a type of matrix that provides an efficient way to store and process data in cases where most of the entries in the matrix are zero. In a sparse matrix, only the non-zero entries are stored, which can significantly reduce storage requirements and improve computational efficiency. This is particularly useful in many real-world applications, such as graph representation, natural language processing, and machine learning, where the input data is often in high dimensional space with very few non-zero entries.

There are several common methods to represent a sparse matrix, including the coordinate list (COO), compressed sparse row (CSR), compressed sparse column (CSC), and diagonal (DIA) format. Among these, COO stores each non-zero entry with its row and column index, CSR represents the matrix by storing the non-zero entries in each row, and CSC does the same for each column.

Sparse matrix allows us to apply some space and time tradeoff to optimize our computation. By applying a dense matrix (such as suggest matrix with every row/column filled with zeros) and sparse matrix operation from scipy, we are able to speed up our computation with reasonable compromise."
"Please explain what is ""Learning rate""","['In machine learning and statistics, the learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Since it influences to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information, it metaphorically represents the speed at which a machine learning model ""learns"". In the adaptive control literature, the learning rate is commonly referred to as gain.\nIn setting a learning rate, there is a trade-off between the rate of convergence and overshooting. While the descent direction is usually determined from the gradient of the loss function, the learning rate determines how big a step is taken in that direction. A too high learning rate will make the learning jump over minima but a too low learning rate will either take too long to converge or get stuck in an undesirable local minimum.\nIn order to achieve faster convergence, prevent oscillations and getting stuck in undesirable local minima the learning rate is often varied during training either in accordance to a learning rate schedule or by using an adaptive learning rate. The learning rate and its adjustments may also differ per parameter, in which case it is a diagonal matrix that can be interpreted as an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian matrix in Newton\'s method. The learning rate is related to the step length determined by inexact line search in quasi-Newton methods and related optimization algorithms.\nWhen conducting line searches, mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) affect the characteristics of the loss function along which the learning rate needs to be resolved. Static MBSS keeps the mini-batch fixed along a search direction, resulting in a smooth loss function along the search direction. Dynamic MBSS updates the mini-batch at every function evaluation, resulting in a point-wise discontinuous loss function along the search direction. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for static MBSS loss functions include the parabolic approximation line (PAL) search. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for dynamic MBSS loss functions include probabilistic line searches,[10] gradient-only line searches (GOLS)[11] and quadratic approximations.[12]']","[""In machine learning, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the optimizer makes updates to the model parameters. It is a key factor in the training process of a neural network, as it controls how fast or slow the model learns.\n\n\n\nThe learning rate is usually set before training the model and remains constant throughout the training process. A larger learning rate means that the model will make larger updates to the model parameters with each training step, while a smaller learning rate means that the updates will be smaller.\n\n\n\nThere are a few different approaches to setting the learning rate. One approach is to manually set the learning rate to a fixed value, but this can be difficult because the optimal learning rate can vary widely depending on the specific model and dataset. A more common approach is to use a learning rate schedule, which adjusts the learning rate over time based on the performance of the model. For example, the learning rate may start off high and then gradually decrease as training progresses.\n\n\n\nIt's important to choose an appropriate learning rate, as a learning rate that is too high can cause the model to diverge and a learning rate that is too low can make the training process slow and inefficient. Finding the right balance is key to successfully training a machine learning model.""]","In machine learning, learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters. The learning rate represents how fast the model should learn or to what extend it should trust its previous training. A small learning rate may result in the model learns too slow, while a larger learning rate may result that the model learns too fast and failed to find the optimal loss. Specifically, to find the best learning rate during the training, the best practice is at the beginning of the training, we set a relatively larger learning rate, and multiply it by 1/10 every time we observe the loss is improved, this could ensure that the model is able to learn ""first"" from the loss landscape with large learning rate, however, after some rounds of learning when it gets closer to the optimal lost, the learning rate shrinked and model is converging to the optimal solution."
"Please explain what is ""Hyperparameter optimization""","['In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.\nThe same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data.  The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss. Cross-validation is often used to estimate this generalization performance.']","[""Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the optimal values for a model's hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a model, and they can greatly impact the performance of a model. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate for training a neural network, the number of layers and neurons in a network, the type of loss function to use, and the regularization strength.\n\n\n\nHyperparameter optimization is an important step in the process of building and training a machine learning model. Choosing the right hyperparameters can make a big difference in the accuracy and efficiency of a model. There are several methods that can be used to optimize hyperparameters, including manual tuning, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.\n\n\n\nIn manual tuning, the hyperparameters are selected by the practitioner based on their experience and knowledge of the problem. This can be time-consuming and may not always lead to the best results.\n\n\n\nIn grid search, the practitioner defines a grid of hyperparameter values and the model is trained and evaluated using each combination of values. This can be computationally expensive, especially for large grids and complex models.\n\n\n\nIn random search, the practitioner defines a distribution of hyperparameter values and a random set of values is drawn from this distribution for each iteration. This can be less computationally expensive than grid search, but it may not be as thorough.\n\n\n\nBayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian statistics to model the function being optimized and then selects the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate based on this model. This can be more efficient than grid search or random search, but it can be more complex to implement.""]","The most important difference is that GPT used ""Hyperparameter optimization"", which is the process of adjusting key parameters in training the model, to enhance its performance. The authors used Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune the parameters in GPT. Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method to solve optimization issues. Rather than iterate randomly (uniform function in hyperopt), Bayesian Optimization uses prior knowledge. So it keeps a ""model"" of given data and make use of it to find a prediction of target variable or in our case the right hyperparameters. Therefore, it avoids wasted iterations and becomes more efficient.  GPT-3.5B searched for the optimal learning rate and found an almost 10x jump from 5e-6 to 4e-5. A well fine-tuned learning rate leads to a better reading comprehension score. The effect of having a well optimized learning rate provides evidence showed that hyperparameter optimization is crucial"

"Please explain what is ""Field-effect transistor""","['The field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current in a semiconductor.  FETs (JFETs or MOSFETs) are devices with three terminals: source, gate, and drain. FETs control the flow of current by the application of a voltage to the gate, which in turn alters the conductivity between the drain and source.\nFETs are also known as unipolar transistors since they involve single-carrier-type operation. That is, FETs use either electrons (n-channel) or holes (p-channel) as charge carriers in their operation, but not both. Many different types of field effect transistors exist. Field effect transistors generally display very high input impedance at low frequencies. The most widely used field-effect transistor is the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor).']","['A field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current through a channel of semiconductor material.

The gate terminal is used to control the flow of current between the source and drain by applying a voltage to the gate.\n\n\n\nFETs are divided into two main types: enhancement-mode and depletion-mode. In an enhancement-mode FET, the channel is ""turned off"" when the gate voltage is zero and is ""turned on"" when a positive voltage is applied to the gate. In a depletion-mode FET, the channel is ""turned on"" when the gate voltage is zero and is ""turned off"" when a negative voltage is applied to the gate.\n\n\n\nFETs are widely used in electronic circuits because they have very low power consumption, high input impedance, and can operate at high speeds.

As a result, FET can be operated in three modes: cutoff, saturation, and linear, which makes it a versatile electronic switch. Comparing to its sibling, Bipolar Junction Transistor, FET has much higher input resistance and are less susceptible to noise interference, which makes FET an ideal choice for many applications such as amplifier, oscillator, and logic gate."
"Please explain what is ""Hardware accelerator""","['Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware designed to perform specific functions more efficiently when compared to software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data that can be calculated in software running on a generic CPU can also be calculated in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both.\nTo perform computing tasks more quickly (or better in some other way), generally one can invest time and money in improving the software, improving the hardware, or both. There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\nHardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.[10] The disadvantage however, is that in many open source projects, it requires proprietary libraries that not all vendors are keen to distribute or expose, making it difficult to integrate in such projects.']","['A hardware accelerator is a specialized hardware device that performs a specific function or set of functions more efficiently than a general-purpose computer or processor.

"Please explain what is ""Frequency comb""","[""In optics, a frequency comb is a laser source whose spectrum consists of a series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media, or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to this last mechanism, which was developed around the turn of the 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W.

The spacing between the frequencies is called the comb spacing, and it is typically on the order of a few megahertz or gigahertz.

They are used, for example, in precision spectroscopy, metrology, and telecommunications. They can also be used to generate ultra-short optical pulses, which have many applications in fields such as nonlinear optics and precision measurement.\n\n\n\nThere are several different ways to generate a frequency comb, but one of the most common methods is to use a mode-locked laser. Mode-locking is a technique in which the laser cavity is actively stabilized, resulting in the emission of a series of very short, equally spaced pulses of light. The spectrum of each pulse is a frequency comb, with the comb spacing determined by the repetition rate of the pulses. Other methods for generating frequency combs include electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical processes, and microresonator systems.']","Frequency comb is used to measure spectral properties with extraordinary precision, over a wide spectral range. In its most prevalent form, a frequency comb contains equidistant spectral lines whose frequencies are known exactly because they are (co)generated by a precision laser. Today, frequency combs universally rely on the generation and detection of ultrashort pulses. The spectrum spans around one octave at least, yet despite the Fourier-factor of coherence between the modes of the optical field, frequency combs are deterministic and in principle simple objects, with a low frequency counterpart akin to a salt and pepper representation of the spectrum of the comb. Frequencies in the low frequency (RF) part of the comb are used to lock the comb to a microwave, allowing the transfer of extreme precision of the microwave physics to the optical part of the frequency comb."

This technology detects, generates, transports, and processes light. Photonic integrated circuits utilize photons (or particles of light) as opposed to electrons that are utilized by electronic integrated circuits. The major difference between the two is that a photonic integrated circuit provides functions for information signals imposed on optical wavelengths typically in the visible spectrum or near infrared (850–1650\xa0nm).\nThe most commercially utilized material platform for photonic integrated circuits is indium phosphide (InP), which allows for the integration of various optically active and passive functions on the same chip. Initial examples of photonic integrated circuits were simple 2-section distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, consisting of two independently controlled device sections – a gain section and a DBR mirror section. Consequently, all modern monolithic tunable lasers, widely tunable lasers, externally modulated lasers and transmitters, integrated receivers, etc. are examples of photonic integrated circuits. As of 2012, devices integrate hundreds of functions onto a single chip.  \nPioneering work in this arena was performed at Bell Laboratories.

When a new sentence needs to be translated, the system searches the database for examples that are similar to the new sentence and uses them as a reference to generate a translation.\n\n\n\nEBMT is a relatively simple and fast method of machine translation, but it has some limitations. One limitation is that it relies on the availability of good quality, relevant examples in the database, which may not always be the case. Additionally, EBMT can struggle to handle text that is significantly different from the examples in the database, or text that contains words or phrases that are not present in the database.\n\n\n\nOverall, EBMT can be a useful tool for machine translation, particularly in situations where there is a limited amount of text to be translated and the quality of the translation is not critical. However, it may not be the best choice for translation tasks that require a high level of accuracy or for translating text that is significantly different from the examples in the database.']","The Paper ""A search engine for 3D models"" is an old paper in 2008, by using example-based machine translation techniques, Google Translate allows users to translate text 264from one language to another while retaining the precise meaning of the message. Instead of using the traditional method of retrieving a complete sentence from a large corpus, Example-based Machine Translation retrieves sentences from previously translated text pieces, which demonstrate similarities to the original sentence. For example, rather than retrieving an entire sentence from a large corpus, the system searches for examples in which comparable sentences were translated Conversely, the example-based machine translation technique allows a user to retrieve contextually exact texts from translations that are contextually similar. The system then substitutes the sentence's original words with the words from its retrieved example to generate an accurate translation. In this way, the machine translation process is approached from a sentence-based perspective. Ultimately, this enables the user to produce a result that is both accurate and contextually appropriate. Additionally, the example-based machine translation technique even maintains the original sentence's originality, allowing it to be cultured and academic in nature, as well as contextually specific."

Four of the six known ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD, and was the cause of the 2013–2016 epidemic in western Africa, which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths.\nEbola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new ""strain"" of the closely related Marburg virus. The virus was renamed ""Ebola virus"" in 2010 to avoid confusion. Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus, which is assigned to the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The members of the species are called Zaire ebolaviruses. The natural reservoir of Ebola virus is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans through body fluids.\nThe EBOV genome is a single-stranded RNA, approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).[10]\nBecause of its high fatality rate (up to 83 to 90 percent),[11][12] EBOV is also listed as a select agent, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), a US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, US CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group.[citation needed]']","['Ebola virus is a viral illness that is caused by the Ebola virus.

It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, breastfeeding, or the reuse of needles and syringes contaminated with the virus.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) typically appear within 2 to 21 days after infection, although it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear. Early symptoms of EVD may include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. As the disease progresses, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and external bleeding from the eyes, ears, and nose. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death.\n\n\n\nThere is no specific treatment for EVD, and the virus has a high mortality rate.

Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.\nOne of the first accounts of the term customer lifetime value is in the 1988 book Database Marketing, which includes detailed worked examples.

Identity fraud involves the use of someone else's personal information to gain access to their accounts or assets. Payment fraud involves the unauthorized use of payment methods, such as credit cards or online payment systems.\n\n\n\nTo detect fraud, organizations and individuals use a variety of techniques, including data analysis, machine learning, and manual reviews. These techniques may involve analyzing patterns in data, comparing transactions to known fraudulent activity, or conducting investigations to identify and verify the authenticity of transactions.\n\n\n\nOverall, the goal of fraud detection is to identify and prevent fraudulent activity before it causes harm or financial loss.""]","Fraud detection refers to the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities. The most common form of fraud detection is the utilization of statistics-based anomaly detection. Statistical models assesses the probability of fraud for every transaction. That probability was then crowd source with the information from previous detection to allow the model to make future detection. Other method includes model transaction processing time, comparing the time spent in different part of the transaction to determine weather the transaction is legitimate. In addition, human interaction within the platform makes it a two-way confirmation of the transaction. However, since fraud detection models sits on the centralized platforms which users have no control of, misuse of data might happen. The suspicious activities involving the same malignant user in different decentralized platforms will not be detected, since each platform has no global coverage of the existence of such malignant user."
"Please explain what is ""Partial differential equation""","['In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.\nThe function is often thought of as an ""unknown"" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability.[citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.\nPartial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.\nPartly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no ""general theory"" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.\nOrdinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the ""PDE"" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.']","['A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that involves partial derivatives of a function with respect to two or more independent variables. PDEs are used to describe the behavior of many different physical systems, including fluid flow, heat transfer, and the vibration of structures.\n\n\n\nAn example of a partial differential equation is the heat equation, which describes how the temperature of a solid object changes over time. The heat equation is written as:\n\n\n\n∂T/∂t = κ ∂^2T/∂x^2\n\n\n\nHere, T is the temperature of the object at a given point in space and time, t is time, x is the position in space, and κ is a constant known as the thermal diffusivity. The partial derivative ∂T/∂t represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time, and the second partial derivative ∂^2T/∂x^2 represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to space.\n\n\n\nPDEs are used to model a wide range of phenomena, from the movement of fluids to the distribution of electricity in a circuit. They are an important tool in many areas of science and engineering, and are typically solved using numerical methods or analytical techniques.']","A differential equation is a type of equation that relates a function (usually a function of several variables) to its derivatives. In particular, a partial differential equation (PDE) is a type of differential equation that relates a function to its partial derivatives. Since a PDE involves multiple variables, there are typically multiple derivatives involved, and solving a PDE generally require solving for all the variables simultaneously. 

PDEs show up in many branches of physics and engineering, since, by relating a function to its derivatives, PDE can describe diverse phenomena from heat dissipation, fluid flow to electromagnetism. In addition, PDEs are also widely used in areas such as finance and biology as well. 

Solving general PDEs are usually very hard, and there are seldom general algorithms to solve them. However, there are many special types of PDEs that allow us to develop techniques to solve them, such as the method of characteristics, separation of variables, and Fourier series and transform.

"Please explain what is ""Navier–Stokes equations""","[""In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/ nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes).\nThe Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier–Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier–Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).\nThe Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.\nThe Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions—i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain. This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1\xa0million prize for a solution or a counterexample.""]","['The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids, such as gases and liquids.

It also explains how different flows behaviors, turbulence and viscosities will affect the fluid flow, which is super important for a wide range of application fields, including but not limited to mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and computer graphics. However, these equations are very difficult to solve due to its nonlinearity, four different variables and strong-dependence on boundary conditions.

With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels.  In addition, previously performed analytical or empirical analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison.

This is often used to explain why some organisms live longer than others, or why some people seem to age more quickly or slowly than others.\n\n\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that ageing is influenced by a number of factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices. Some scientists believe that the ageing process is regulated by certain genes that control the rate at which cells divide and repair themselves, and that these genes may be responsible for the differences in lifespan and ageing rate that we observe in different species and individuals.\n\n\n\nWhile the concept of an ""ageing clock"" is still the subject of much research and debate, it is generally accepted that the rate of ageing is not fixed and can be influenced by a variety of factors. Some studies have suggested that interventions such as diet and exercise may be able to slow the ageing process, while others have found that certain genetic mutations or treatments may be able to extend lifespan.']","In contrast to the common population ageing established on chronological age, the concept of 'ageing clock' refers to a biological age typically represented on the basis of particular biomarkers, such as frailty index, epigenetic ageing, or transcriptomic age. The biological age reflects well the heterogeneity in the ageing process within the population. For instance, two women with the same passport age may have different biological age due to health conditions, lifestyle choices, or genetic factors. 

The ageing clock differs from traditional approaches in longevity studies, which typically focus on identifying genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors when explaining the age-related diseases, frailty, or clinical outcomes. Instead, the 'ageing clock' provides a more precise measure on the ageing process based on a comprehensive set of biomarkers. Consequently, it is useful in foretelling individual specific health condition, in which the chronological age often fails to capture, and grasping the population aging process, where chronological age alone becomes inadequate. 

Comprehensive studies have been conducted to develop a precise and informative ageing clock. With the help of factors such as DNA methylation patterns, lifestyle and mental health, a highly informational clock can be established in a manner that enables easy implementation in clinical settings. Inspired by the concept of a ‘clock,’ I am motivated to explore more advanced methodology incorporating with emerging biotechnologies."
"Please explain what is ""Biomarkers of aging""","['Biomarkers of aging are biomarkers that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than chronological age. Stated another way, biomarkers of aging would give the true ""biological age"", which may be different from the chronological age.\nValidated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to extend lifespan, because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.  Although maximum lifespan would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because longitudinal studies would take far too much time.  Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of aging and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism. An assemblage of biomarker data for an organism could be termed its ""ageotype"".\nAlthough graying of hair increases with age, hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age.

Levels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.\nAdvances in big data analysis allowed for the new types of ""aging clocks"" to be developed. The epigenetic clock is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age.

The usual representation of this black box system  is a data flow diagram centered in the box.\nThe opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a white box (sometimes also known as a ""clear box"" or a ""glass box"").']","['A black box is a system, device, or process that can be studied or analyzed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings. The term ""black box"" is often used to describe systems or processes that are complex, or whose inner workings are not well understood or are hidden from the observer.\n\n\n\nIn the context of science and engineering, a black box is a device or system that can be observed in terms of its inputs and outputs, but the internal workings of the system are not known or are not accessible to the observer. For example, a computer program might be considered a black box if the programmer does not have access to the source code or the program\'s internal algorithms.

"Please explain what is ""Deductive reasoning""","['Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive inferences. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises ""all men are mortal"" and ""Socrates is a man"" to the conclusion ""Socrates is mortal"" is deductively valid. An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true. Some theorists define deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author\'s belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. \nPsychology is interested in deductive reasoning as a psychological process, i.e. how people actually draw inferences. Logic, on the other hand, focuses on the deductive relation of logical consequence between the premises and the conclusion or how people should draw inferences. There are different ways of conceptualizing this relation. According to the semantic approach, an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation of this argument where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The syntactic approach, on the other hand, holds that an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference. A rule of inference is a schema of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their logical form. There are various rules of inference, like the modus ponens and the modus tollens. Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called formal fallacies. Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast to strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion. Deductive reasoning contrasts with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. For ampliative arguments, like inductive or abductive arguments, the premises offer weaker support to their conclusion: they make it more likely but they do not guarantee its truth. They make up for this drawback by being able to provide genuinely new information not already found in the premises, unlike deductive arguments.\nCognitive psychology investigates the mental processes responsible for deductive reasoning. One of its topics concerns the factors determining whether people draw valid or invalid deductive inferences. One factor is the form of the argument: for example, people are more successful for arguments of the form modus ponens than for modus tollens. Another is the content of the arguments: people are more likely to believe that an argument is valid if the claim made in its conclusion is plausible. A general finding is that people tend to perform better for realistic and concrete cases than for abstract cases. Psychological theories of deductive reasoning aim to explain these findings by providing an account of the underlying psychological processes. Mental logic theories hold that deductive reasoning is a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations using rules of inference. Mental model theories, on the other hand, claim that deductive reasoning involves models of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. According to dual-process theories of reasoning, there are two qualitatively different cognitive systems responsible for reasoning.\nThe problem of deductive reasoning is relevant to various fields and issues. Epistemology tries to understand how justification is transferred from the belief in the premises to the belief in the conclusion in the process of deductive reasoning. Probability logic studies how the probability of the premises of an inference affects the probability of its conclusion. The controversial thesis of deductivism denies that there are other correct forms of inference besides deduction. Natural deduction is a type of proof system based on simple and self-evident rules of inference. In philosophy, the geometrical method is a way of philosophizing that starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system using deductive reasoning.']","['Deductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking in which a conclusion is drawn based on the relationship between two or more premises. This type of reasoning starts with a general statement, or premise, and applies it to a specific situation to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the following argument:\n\n\n\nPremise 1: All birds can fly.\n\nPremise 2: Eagles are birds.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, eagles can fly.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the conclusion that eagles can fly is drawn based on the relationship between the two premises: that all birds can fly and that eagles are birds. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\n\n\nDeductive reasoning is often contrasted with inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions based on observations or specific examples. While deductive reasoning is a reliable method for arriving at conclusions when the premises are true, it is not always possible to determine the truth of the premises with certainty. In such cases, the conclusion may not necessarily be reliable.']","Deductive reasoning is when you draw conclusions based on you're observation and prior knowledge. Typically you would use this conventions: You observe a lot of X. X often has a characteristic A. Therefore, you conclude that any X you would see in the future will also have characteristic A. The characteristic A is your prior knowledge, so you would use these prior knowledge and generalization of observations to draw conclusions. Deductive reasoning plays a significant role in both philosophy and logical side in mathematics. On the other hand, through induction, dedutive reasoning can also help improve the credibility of your conclusions, since it's rare to have a perfect logic, and dedutive reasoning can help make partial confident of your result."

Overall, Mr. Taleb believes that these kinds of unpredictable events have shaped history way more significantly than people think they are.

The tape is fed into a device called a punch or a reader, which can interpret the holes and convert them into digital data that can be processed by a computer.

Punched tape was popular because it was relatively cheap and easy to produce. It was also portable, making it easier to transport data between different computers. However, punched tape has several limitations. First, it was a sequential storage medium, meaning that data had to be read or written in a linear fashion. Second, punched tape was prone to physical damage, such as tearing or jamming. Finally, punched tape's low storage capacity made it unsuitable for large-scale data storage.

Despite these limitations, punched tape played a crucial role in the early development of computing and the digitization of data. It was used in a wide range of applications, from simple data entry to more complex tasks like control systems and program storage."

The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.\nGeneralized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. They proposed an iteratively reweighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters. MLE remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages.

The GLM allows for the modeling of this type of data by using a link function to relate the mean of the response variable to a linear combination of the predictor variables.\n\n\n\nIn a GLM, the response variable is assumed to follow a certain distribution, and the mean of this distribution is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables. The parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the data, which is the probability of observing the data given the model.\n\n\n\nExamples of GLMs include logistic regression for modeling binary data, Poisson regression for modeling count data, and gamma regression for modeling continuous data with a positive skew.']","Generalized linear models are generalization of ordinary linear regression, in that the output variable Y can follow different distributions. It allows for this distribution of the Y variable to be estimated based on the given explanatory variables X through a suitable link function. It provides a way to model the linear relationship between the explanatory variables X and the response variable Y when the Y variable follows an exponential family of distribution. Besides, it is suitable for the binary outcome and the dependent variable which is distributed exponentially.
The key differences between GLM and LM is the error distribution of the Y variable, in which the distribution of Y now follows an exponential family which is different from the normal distribution assumed in the linear regression model. The second is the function of the expected value of Y, denoted as the link function which was introduced to connect the algorithm of updating the parameter of the model and the response variable. In other words, instead of directly applying the return of the linear regression model, the link function would receive the input of that function, and then apply it as the new Y variable to efficiently update the model parameter.

Other difficulties include the possibility of counter-intuitive results, such as in case of belief fusion in Dempster–Shafer theory.

"Please explain what is ""Automated medical diagnosis""","[""Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.\nCAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.\nCAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.\nComputer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.\nAlthough CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.""]","[""Automated medical diagnosis is the use of computer algorithms and software to analyze medical data and provide a diagnosis without the need for human intervention.

One benefit is that it can help to reduce the workload of doctors and other healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks and patient care. Automated diagnosis can also be faster and more accurate than human diagnosis, particularly in cases where there is a large volume of data to analyze or where the diagnosis requires specialized expertise.

"Please explain what is ""Symbolic artificial intelligence""","['In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\'s Checker\'s Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]']","['Symbolic artificial intelligence (also known as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned artificial intelligence"" (GOFAI)) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and reasoning to solve problems.

They rely on pre-defined rules and logical reasoning to solve problems and make decisions, rather than learning from data or experience like some other approaches to artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nOne of the key advantages of symbolic AI is that it allows for the explicit representation of complex knowledge and logical reasoning. This can be useful in situations where there are clear rules and logical relationships between different pieces of information, and where it is important to be able to explain the reasoning behind a decision. However, symbolic AI can be limited in its ability to deal with the complexity and uncertainty of real-world situations, and it may struggle with tasks that require more flexible or creative problem-solving approaches.']","Symbolic artificial intelligence is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on using symbols and logic-based representations to simulate human information processing and decision-making. It is rooted in the idea that human intelligence can be broken down into symbolic manipulation and logical reasoning. In a symbolic AI system, information is typically stored in a structured way, such as semantic network or production rules, and reasoning is done by applying logical inference rules to those symbols. The most famous symbolic AI, expert systems, use symbolic representations and perform logical inferences to solve a specific problem such as medical diagnosis. Symbolic AI is strong at reasoning and recommendation; however, its inherent weakness is that the representations and inferences can become overly complex in the real world, which is full of uncertainties and ambiguities."
"Please explain what is ""Probability theory""","['Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.\nCentral subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).\nAlthough it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\nAs a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation. A great discovery of twentieth-century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.']","['Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence.

"Please explain what is ""Loss function""","['In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function)  is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some ""cost"" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.\nIn statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.']","[""A loss function is a mathematical function that maps a set of predictions and their corresponding true values to a real number that represents the cost or penalty associated with the predictions.

For example, in a classification task, the cross-entropy loss is often used, while in a regression task, the mean squared error (MSE) loss is often used.\n\n\n\nThe loss function is an essential component of a machine learning model because it helps the model learn to make accurate predictions by providing a measure of how well the model's predictions match the true values. The model can then use this measure to adjust its internal parameters in an attempt to minimize the loss and improve its predictions.""]","Loss function quantifies the error between the estimated values and ground truth. It measures how well the model performs its task. Loss functions for classification problem include but not limit to: logistic loss, hinge loss, and exponential loss. They measure the compatibility between predicated score and true label, and give high penalty when the predicated score is far away from the true label.

The central limit theorem supports this estimation and allows us to apply inferential statistics to ensure accurate results. Secondly, interval estimation, uses sample statistics to provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter, such as a confidence interval.

Instead of surveying or analyzing the entire population, which is often time-consuming, costly, or impossible to do so, a subset of the population, namely, the sample, is surveyed instead. The sample, although not the entire population, should be representative of the population that the researcher is interested in understanding.

For example, when polling, it is expensive and time-consuming to survey every registered voter, therefore, people would sample about one thousand to two thousand voters to estimate who is likely to win in the election — the result is the ratio of votes that candidates win from the sample. By understanding the basic statistics, it is then really easy to create a more in-depth understanding of the overall population.

The advantages of using a sample to estimate population parameters include increased efficiency and reduced costs. In addition, sample results are often less biased than census data. Sample bias can be significantly reduced by taking a random sample, which requires each member of the population to have an equal chance of being selected for the sample."

On the other hand, the variance of an algorithm quantifies the error that is introduced by the algorithm's sensitivity to the specific subset of training data used to train it. It is important to find a trade-off between bias and variance, as finding a model that is too complex will lead to low bias but high variance, while finding a model that is too simple will lead to high bias but low variance.

Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.\nSince an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.:\u200a226\u200a Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity.

An algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) takes at most a certain number of steps for each possible pair of elements in the input data.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that time complexity is a measure of the worst-case performance of an algorithm. This means that the time complexity of an algorithm describes the maximum amount of time it could take to solve a problem, rather than the average or expected amount of time.\n\n\n\nThere are many factors that can affect the time complexity of an algorithm, including the type of operations it performs and the specific input data it is given. Some algorithms are more efficient than others, and it is often important to choose the most efficient algorithm for a particular problem in order to save time and resources.']","""Time Complexity"" is a term used in computer science and algorithm that allows programmer to understand the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm. By using ""Time complexity"", programmer can analyze if their current algorithm solution is efficient, or if there would be a better solution for the current problem. 

Time complexity analysis can be mainly separated into two parts: ""Big O""(worst case) and ""Omega""(best case).

""Big O"" represents the worst possible running time that an algorithm can gave. By finding the ""Big O"", programmer can understand the maximum time the program could requires and have a brief understanding of how the algorithm would perform for the worst scenario.

""Omega"" represents the best possible running time that an algorithm can gave. By finding the ""Omega"", programmer can understand the minimum time the program requires and have a brief understanding of how the algorithm would perform for the best scenario.

However, in practical, we are unlikely to use ""Omega""(since we are more like looking for the worst case scenario in a real-life program). Instead, we usually use ""Big O"" to analysis the time complexity (efficiency) of an algorithm."
"Please explain what is ""Array data structure""","['In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.\nFor example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i × 4).\nThe memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.\nBecause the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called ""matrices"". In some cases the term ""vector"" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word ""table"" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\nArrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.\nThe term ""array"" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.\nThe term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or ""abstract array"", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.']","['An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items, typically in a contiguous block of memory. The items in an array are usually of the same data type, and are accessed using an index.\n\n\n\nIn many programming languages, an array is implemented as a fixed-size sequenced collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is assigned a unique index, which is used to identify and access the element. The first element in the array is assigned an index of 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1, and so on.\n\n\n\nHere is an example of how you might declare and initialize an array of integers in C:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nint numbers[5];\n\nnumbers[0] = 10;\n\nnumbers[1] = 20;\n\nnumbers[2] = 30;\n\nnumbers[3] = 40;\n\nnumbers[4] = 50;\n\nIn this example, we have declared an array called numbers that can hold 5 integers. We have then initialized the array by assigning values to each element in the array. We can access the elements of the array using their indexes, like this:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nprintf(""%d"", numbers[0]);  // prints 10\n\nprintf(""%d"", numbers[2]);  // prints 30\n\nArrays are a useful data structure for storing and manipulating large amounts of data, but they have some limitations. For example, the size of an array is fixed when it is created, so you cannot easily add or remove elements from the array. In addition, arrays are not well-suited for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the collection. For these types of operations, you might want to consider using a different data structure such as a linked list.']","An ""Array"" is a basic data structure used to store a collection of elements. It has a fixed size and each element in the array can be accessed based on its index. An array is particularly useful for scenarios where we need to quickly access the elements at arbitrary locations. For example, in a video game, we can store all positions of enemies in an array and check their collisions with the player easily. 

To access an element in an array, we only need its index number, which can be either a fixed value or a variable. Note that, this index has to be equal to or larger than zero and less than the size of the array, otherwise we will receive an error message which is commonly known as ""IndexOutOfBounds"" error in 271. However, we can dynamically change the content in the index by the variable with the ""[] "", so that we do not need to write a lot of ""if"" statements.

An array is particularly useful when the numbers of ""objects"" we want to store in the array are relatively large. First, we need less lines of code to define multiple variables for each objects. Second, not only the updating process of the elements in the code is more systematic, but the ""for loops"" for different kinds of operations become more straightforward."

Another similar application of similarity learning is A/B testing. A/B testing is frequently used in industrial scenarios such as Taobao recommendation. By using similarity learning group buyer into different cluster, A/B testing can be conducted within one single group and therefore avoiding noises from buyers that do not belong to specific group.  Similarity learning can also be extended to online recommendation systems where buyers can get recommendation from fellow users who cluster close to them instead of purchasing  most ranked products."
"Please explain what is ""Density estimation""","['In statistics, probability density estimation or simply density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function.  The unobservable density function is thought of as the density according to which a large population is distributed; the data are usually thought of as a random sample from that population.\nA variety of approaches to density estimation are used, including Parzen windows and a range of data clustering techniques, including vector quantization. The most basic form of density estimation is a rescaled histogram.']","['Density estimation is the process of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable.

It is used to specify the probability of an event occurring within a particular interval or range of values. The PDF is defined as the derivative of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable.\n\n\n\nThere are various techniques for estimating the density of a random variable, including kernel density estimation, histogram-based methods, and parametric methods. Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the appropriate method to use depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.\n\n\n\nIn general, density estimation is an important tool in statistical analysis and machine learning, as it allows us to better understand the distribution of data and make more informed decisions based on that data.

This methodology is widely used in finance, healthcare, social science and other fields. Let's consider the application of density estimation in finance. Given a sequence of historical stock prices, mimicking the kernel-based density estimation, we place a kernel function over every single historical data point, and then sum over them to obtain the final density distribution. The bandwidth of the kernel function is a hyperparameter that affects the smoothness of the kernel estimator. The kernel density estimator is a non-parametric approach, which is able to capture the complex patterns in the data. For example, it's able to handle multimodal distributions, where the data may have more than one peak. A more generalized version of kernel density estimator is the mixture density estimation, which is widely used in the generative modeling task"
"Please explain what is ""Probability density function""","['In probability theory, a probability density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would be close to that sample. Probability density  is the  probability per unit length,  in other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.\nIn a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable\'s PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to 1.\nThe terms ""probability distribution function"" and ""probability function"" have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, ""probability distribution function"" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. ""Density function"" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion. In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.']","['A probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the probability of an event occurring within a certain range of values. It is a continuous function, meaning that it can take on any value within a certain range, as opposed to a discrete function, which can only take on specific, discrete values.\n\n\n\nThe probability density function is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It is defined such that the total area under the curve of the function is equal to 1, which represents the total probability of all possible outcomes. The probability of a specific range of values occurring is equal to the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a continuous random variable X that has a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. The PDF of this random variable is given by the following equation:\n\n\n\nf(x) = (1 / (σ * √(2π))) * e^-(((x - μ)^2) / (2σ^2))\n\n\n\nThis function describes the probability of X taking on any value within a certain range. The probability of X taking on a specific value is technically zero, since X is a continuous variable and can take on an infinite number of values within a certain range. However, the probability of X taking on a value within a certain range can be calculated by finding the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.\n\n\n\nIn general, the probability density function is a useful tool for understanding the probability distribution of a continuous random variable and for making statistical inferences about the variable.']","The 'probability density function' is used to describe continuous random variables in statistics. While the cumulative distribution function(CDF) prespesent the probability that a random variable X will take on a value less than or equal to x, the pdf provides the probability of a random variable X is exactly equal to x, which, intuitively, is the slope of CDF at x. Consider, for example, a high-normal distribution - we would expect any value taken will be within the range. In this setting, the probability of any exact value will be 0, and the highest probabilty will be at the centroid - the mode, which has the maximum value on the probability density function."

This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point.

Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed. This is a time-consuming method and improves the performance partially. To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution. Such methods are known as ‘numerical optimization’ or ‘simulation-based optimization’.\nIn simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values.

Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.\nIf sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.']","['Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. It is a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem. The key to using dynamic programming is to identify a recursive structure in the problem, as well as an ""optimal substructure"" that can be exploited to break the problem down into smaller pieces.\n\n\n\nDynamic programming algorithms are often used for optimization problems, where the goal is to find the optimal solution among a set of possible solutions. These algorithms typically involve solving the same subproblems multiple times, so it is important to store the solutions to these subproblems in a table or an array to avoid re-computing them.

Dynamic programming is especially useful when the problem has overlapping subproblems, meaning that the same subproblem is solved multiple times in the problem-solving process. By storing and reusing the results of solved subproblems, dynamic programming reduces the number of redundant calculations and improves computational efficiency. 

Dynamic programming involves three main steps: 
1) Decompose the problem into subproblems: Identify the core problems and the relationships between them, and decompose the problem into a set of smaller and more manageable subproblems.
2) Define the state: Represent each subproblem with a state, which should be concise and contain all necessary information to calculate the solution to the subproblem.
3) Formulate the recurrence relation and solve the subproblems: Use a recurrence relation to express the solution to the original problem in terms of the solutions to its subproblems, and solve the subproblems in a bottom-up or top-down manner.

Dynamic programming is widely used in various fields, such as computer science, economics, and operations research. It is particularly useful in optimization and resource allocation problems, such as the knapsack problem, shortest path problems, and scheduling problems. Dynamic programming has also been applied in natural language processing, machine learning, and other computational intelligence areas."
"Please explain what is ""Principal component analysis""","[""Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n unit vectors, where the \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n−\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.\nIn data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.\nPCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n−\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.\nFor either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.

Nevertheless, in reality, not every single characteristic could be simply transformed and treated as nu. Manifold learning is a technique for processing and analyze multi-feature data. It can be seen as a generalization of linear mapping, which assumes that the multi-feature data points actually reside, or aligns in a manifold. Nevertheless, t he manifold might be folded or curve-shaped rather than flat, which adjoins high flexibility to community detection. According to the theory of manifold learning, various dimensions could be defined in the multi-feature space, where similarity between such multi-feature data points are represented by cosine similarity. By mapping community-aligned (=connected) data points together in this feature-oriented space, manifold learning balances the deviation caused by the different scale of the different features and meanwhile gives more credence to the importance of intra-feature distance. Consequently, given a certain recommendation feature, manifold learning would enable us to recognize our users, who are very in favor of restaurants that have priced lower in the past in case they are broke, and recommend them relatively cheaper restaurants in general."
"Please explain what is ""Manifold regularization""","['In machine learning, Manifold regularization is a technique for using the shape of a dataset to constrain the functions that should be learned on that dataset. In many machine learning problems, the data to be learned do not cover the entire input space. For example, a facial recognition system may not need to classify any possible image, but only the subset of images that contain faces. The technique of manifold learning assumes that the relevant subset of data comes from a manifold, a mathematical structure with useful properties. The technique also assumes that the function to be learned is smooth: data with different labels are not likely to be close together, and so the labeling function should not change quickly in areas where there are likely to be many data points. Because of this assumption, a manifold regularization algorithm can use unlabeled data to inform where the learned function is allowed to change quickly and where it is not, using an extension of the technique of Tikhonov regularization. Manifold regularization algorithms can extend supervised learning algorithms in semi-supervised learning and transductive learning settings, where unlabeled data are available. The technique has been used for applications including medical imaging, geographical imaging, and object recognition.']","['Manifold regularization is a technique that is used to regularize machine learning models in order to improve their generalization performance. It is based on the idea that the data that the model is being trained on lies on a low-dimensional manifold, which is embedded in a higher-dimensional space.\n\n\n\nThe goal of manifold regularization is to enforce the model to respect this underlying structure of the data and to avoid fitting to noise or outliers. This can be achieved by adding a regularization term to the objective function of the model, which penalizes deviations from the manifold.\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to incorporate manifold regularization into a machine learning model. One common approach is to use a graph-based regularization term, which encourages the model to stay close to the data points that are connected by edges in the graph. Another approach is to use an autoencoder, which is trained to reconstruct the input data from a low-dimensional latent representation. The reconstruction loss can then be used as a regularization term to encourage the model to stay close to the manifold.\n\n\n\nManifold regularization has been shown to be effective in a variety of machine learning tasks, including classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

Different from traditional regularization methods, manifold regularization seeks to minimize both the empirical loss and the intrinsic complexity of data manifold. By assuming that the data lives on or near a low-dimensional manifold, manifold regularization avoids overfitting and boosts performance in tasks such as classification and regression. The manifold regularization term encourages that data points which are close in the high dimensional space should project nearby on the manifold, such as the Laplacian regularization term, which can be obtained by constructing a graph based on pairwise similarity. Manifold regularization has been applied in various tasks, such as cross-domain learning, multi-modal learning, etc, and helps to improve model's robustness and transferability.

"Please explain what is ""Topic modeling""","['In statistics and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract ""topics"" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: ""dog"" and ""bone"" will appear more often in documents about dogs, ""cat"" and ""meow"" will appear in documents about cats, and ""the"" and ""is"" will appear approximately equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. The ""topics"" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discovering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and what each document\'s balance of topics is.\nTopic models are also referred to as probabilistic topic models, which refers to statistical algorithms for discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body. In the age of information, the amount of the written material we encounter each day is simply beyond our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies.

This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.\nOne of the most important applications of sparse dictionary learning is in the field of compressed sensing or signal recovery. In compressed sensing, a high-dimensional signal can be recovered with only a few linear measurements provided that the signal is sparse or nearly sparse. Since not all signals satisfy this sparsity condition, it is of great importance to find a sparse representation of that signal such as the wavelet transform or the directional gradient of a rasterized matrix. Once a matrix or a high dimensional vector is transferred to a sparse space, different recovery algorithms like basis pursuit, CoSaMP or fast non-iterative algorithms can be used to recover the signal.\nOne of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as Fourier or wavelet transforms). However, in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity, which has applications in data decomposition, compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image denoising and classification, video and audio processing.

Also, a priori algorithm is used to reduce the search space for the problem.\nThe support metric in the association rule learning algorithm is defined as the frequency of the antecedent or consequent appearing together in a data set. Moreover, confidence is expressed as the reliability of the association rules determined by the ratio of the data records containing both A and B. The minimum threshold for support and confidence are inputs to the model. Considering all the above-mentioned definitions, affinity analysis can develop rules that will predict the occurrence of an event based on the occurrence of other events. This data mining method has been explored in different fields including disease diagnosis, market basket analysis, retail industry, higher education, and financial analysis. In retail, affinity analysis is used to perform market basket analysis, in which retailers seek to understand the purchase behavior of customers. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling, in addition to influencing sales promotions, loyalty programs, store design, and discount plans.']","['Market basket analysis is a data mining technique that is used to identify relationships between different items that are frequently purchased together. It is typically used in retail to identify items that are commonly purchased together, so that retailers can group these items together in the store or advertise them together to encourage more sales.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a retailer notices that customers who purchase bread are also likely to purchase butter and jam, they might place these items together in the store or advertise them together in a sale. By understanding these patterns in customer purchasing behavior, retailers can improve their marketing efforts and increase sales.\n\n\n\nMarket basket analysis is often used in conjunction with other data mining techniques, such as association rule mining, to identify patterns in large datasets and make informed decisions about marketing and sales strategies.']","Market Basket Analysis is the process of discovering frequent item sets in large transactional data sets.

"Please explain what is ""Web usage mining""","['Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.']","['Web usage mining is the process of using data mining techniques to automatically discover and extract useful information from web log data.

"Please explain what is ""Intrusion detection""","['An intrusion detection system (IDS; also intrusion prevention system or IPS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.\nIDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach. The most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of ""good"" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is reputation-based detection (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system. Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools, such as using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic.']","['Intrusion detection is the process of identifying and responding to attempts to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network. It involves continuously monitoring a system for signs of security breaches or threats, such as attempts to login with unauthorized credentials, unusual network traffic, or modifications to system files. When an intrusion is detected, the system can alert security personnel or take automated actions to prevent or mitigate the attack.\n\n\n\nIntrusion detection systems (IDS) are designed to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. There are several types of IDS, including network-based IDS, host-based IDS, and wireless IDS. Network-based IDS monitors network traffic for signs of intrusion, while host-based IDS monitors activity on a single host or device. Wireless IDS monitors wireless network traffic for security threats.\n\n\n\nIntrusion prevention systems (IPS) are similar to IDS, but they are designed to actively block or mitigate intrusions. They can take a variety of actions in response to a detected intrusion, such as blocking traffic from a particular source, quarantining a device, or shutting down a service.\n\n\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention are important components of a comprehensive security strategy, as they help organizations protect their systems and data from unauthorized access or attacks.']","""Intrusion detection"" refers to a process that identifies and tracks unauthorized or malicious cyber activities, such as hacking or system misusage, for both desktop and mobile devices. Its main goal is to recognize unusual network activities and suspicious patterns, collect relevant information about the medium of attack, and finally report the findings to the system. The detection works in two different modes: in the proactive detection, which is usually table-based and mostly used in academic purposes, the IDS will actively scan devices for potential threats, whereas in the passive detection mode, the IDS will mainly rely on extra community sources, such as the analysis of virus behavior and the collection of the network packets, to identify potential threats. Furthermore, based on the difference in collection and analysis of information, IDS can be categorized into three types: Signature based IDS, which recognizes potential threats by comparing the detect system calls with the standard attacks; Anomaly based IDS, which looks for any abnormal activities comparing to the historical data; and Behavior based IDS, which detects any potential threat by analyzing the pattern in network transfer. Overall, the detection seeks to identify unauthorized access to a target device by learning potential signs of trace left by the outsider."
"Please explain what is ""Continuous production""","['Continuous production is a flow production method used to manufacture, produce, or process materials without interruption.  Continuous production is called a continuous process or a continuous flow process because the materials, either dry bulk or fluids that are being processed are continuously in motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment.  Continuous processing is contrasted with batch production.\nContinuous usually means operating 24 hours per day, seven days per week with infrequent maintenance shutdowns, such as semi-annual or annual.  Some chemical plants can operate for more than one to two years without a shutdown.  Blast furnaces can run from four to ten years without stopping.']","['Continuous production is a manufacturing process in which products are produced in a continuous and uninterrupted flow. This means that the production process is not stopped or interrupted at any point during the production cycle. Instead, raw materials are continuously fed into the production process, and finished products are continuously produced and sent for further processing or packaging.\n\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of continuous production is that it allows for a high level of efficiency and productivity. Since the production process is not stopped or interrupted, there are fewer delays and less time is wasted. Continuous production also allows for the production of large quantities of products in a short amount of time, which can be beneficial in industries where there is a high demand for products.\n\n\n\nThere are several types of continuous production processes, including assembly lines, rolling mills, and extrusion processes. In an assembly line, raw materials are fed into the production process at one end, and finished products are produced at the other end. In a rolling mill, raw materials are fed into a machine that rolls them into a desired shape or size. In an extrusion process, raw materials are fed into a machine that shapes them into a desired shape using pressure and heat.\n\n\n\nContinuous production is often used in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and automotive manufacturing. It is also commonly used in the production of chemicals, plastics, and other industrial materials.']","The concept of ""Continuous production"" deals with the scheduling of classes to meet the requirement of the production unit, which is a technology used in Lean Manufacturing. The goal of Continuous production is to reduce changeovers and setup time and fully optimize the use of technology to allow production to produce on a continuous basis. The concept of Continuous Production can be further classified into two types, Continuous Flow and Continuous Flow Based Production. Continuous Flow means that the production units are connected in series, from the first unit to the last unit. Continuous Flow Based Production, on the other hand, is a more flexible type that allows multiple flows in the same production process. The goal of both types of Continuous production is to reduce the delay between productions and therefore enhances the efficiency of production."
"Please explain what is ""Sequence mining""","['Sequential pattern mining is a topic of data mining concerned with finding statistically relevant patterns between data examples where the values are delivered in a sequence. It is usually presumed that the values are discrete, and thus time series mining is closely related, but usually considered a different activity.  Sequential pattern mining is a special case of structured data mining.\nThere are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field.  These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns, comparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members.  In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms  and itemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models  extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency constructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct.']","['Sequence mining is a type of data mining that involves identifying patterns and relationships within sequences of data.

There are usually two frameworks that people may use of sequence mining: one is prefix-tree based algorithms and the other one is to convert sequence problem as a classification one by divide data into training, validation, and test set. The disadvantage of sequence mining might be the requirement of large storage space and the demand of large-scale data set for reasonable output."
"Please explain what is ""Logic programming""","['Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\nand are read declaratively as logical implications:\nH is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:\nIn the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:\nConsider the following clause as an example:\nbased on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:\ncan be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by ""assigning"" socrates to X.\nThe declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.']","['Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm that is based on formal logic. It is a declarative programming paradigm, meaning that the programmer specifies what the program should do, rather than how it should be done.\n\n\n\nIn logic programming, programs are written in a logical language, such as Prolog. The programmer writes a set of logical statements, called ""clauses,"" that describe the relationships and constraints between different entities. These clauses are then used to make logical deductions and solve problems.\n\n\n\nOne of the main features of logic programming is that it allows for reasoning about uncertain or incomplete information. For example, a logic program might be able to deduce the answer to a question even if it does not have all of the necessary information. This makes it a useful tool for tasks that involve making inferences or solving problems where the information is uncertain or incomplete.\n\n\n\nLogic programming is often used in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, as well as in other areas where the ability to reason about uncertain or incomplete information is important. It is also used in databases, where it can be used to define the structure and constraints of the data, as well as to query the data.']","My understanding of logic programming is that it's a programming paradigm (like functional programming and object-oriented programming) that dictates the use of logical reasoning (e.g. proving theorems in propositional logic, making resolution, conducting unification) to enable computers to execute a series of tasks. In logic programming, instead of instructing computers to go through a set of fixed logics step by step, programmers define a set of facts by using logics (e.g human preferences, visual recognition by computers). Based on these facts and the set of equations aka""Relations"" that programmers define, the computer will reflect its preprocessing result, thus making it easier for programmers to conduct a deduction to the process (e.g. go through the execution process and provide desired results based on the constraints)."

Inductive functional programming, which uses functional programming languages such as Lisp or Haskell, and most especially inductive logic programming, which uses logic programming languages such as Prolog and other logical representations  such as description logics, have been more prominent, but other (programming) language paradigms have also been used, such as constraint programming or probabilistic programming.']","['Inductive programming is a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning that involves the use of computer programs to automatically generate and refine machine learning models based on data.

It strives to find the ""generalization"" of the examples and produce the correct code. Comparing with traditional programming which requires developers to explicitly specify all the steps in the algorithm, inductive programming breaks the limitation of human instruction and is more intuitive and instructive. Given the input-output example and a domain-specific language (DSL) as constraints, inductive programming will search for the most optimal code in the language space that can solve the problem. However, due to the undecidable nature of inductive programming, the general solution is unachievable, and most of the current research focuses on specific domains, such as symbolic regression and list manipulation."
"Please explain what is ""Functional programming""","[""In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.\nIn functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.\nFunctional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.\nFunctional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on functions. Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang,[10][11][12] Elixir,[13] OCaml,[14][15] Haskell,[16][17] and F#.[18][19] Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like JavaScript in the Web,[20] R in statistics,[21][22] J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML.[23][24] Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values.[25] In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++11, C#,[26] Kotlin,[27] Perl,[28] PHP,[29] Python,[30] Go,[31] Rust,[32] Raku,[33] Scala,[34] and Java (since Java 8).[35]""]","['Functional programming is a programming paradigm, or a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

Functions in functional programming do not have side effects, meaning that they do not modify the state of the program or produce any observable interactions with the outside world, such as printing to the console or modifying a file on the filesystem.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming languages often use recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves, to perform complex computations. They also typically use higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s by mathematician Alonzo Church to study the concept of functions. It has been influential in the design of many programming languages, including Lisp, ML, and Haskell.\n\n\n\nFunctional programming can be contrasted with imperative programming, which is based on the idea of changing the state of the program through the use of statements that perform actions and modify variables.

In functional programming, programs are formed by a series of function applications where each function takes one or more inputs and returns one or more outputs.

Instead, it favors immutability and pure functions, which means that the function’s output is solely determined by its inputs and does not have any side effects on the program. The central idea of functional programming lies in passing functions around as first-class values and organizing code into higher order functions. To maximize code reusability and productivity, functions are designed to be composable which means that a function can operate on another function to create new functions. These traits make functional programming especially suitable for writing modular code that allows easy testing and debugging. However, functional programming can be hard to understand because the flow of control is driven by data transformation which making it harder to visualize and reason."

The first, the base case, proves the statement for n\xa0=\xa00 without assuming any knowledge of other cases. The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case n\xa0=\xa0k, then it must also hold for the next case n\xa0=\xa0k\xa0+\u20091.

Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, and is the foundation of most correctness proofs for computer programs.\nAlthough its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be confused with inductive reasoning as used in philosophy (see Problem of induction). The mathematical method examines infinitely many cases to prove a general statement, but does so by a finite chain of deductive reasoning involving the variable n, which can take infinitely many values.']","['Mathematical induction is a method of proof that is used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (positive integers). It is based on the idea that if a statement is true for the base case (usually 0 or 1), and if the statement is true for one natural number, then it must be true for the next natural number. This process is then repeated until the statement has been proven for all natural numbers.\n\n\n\nTo prove a statement using mathematical induction, you must first prove that the statement is true for the base case. For example, if you want to prove that the statement ""for all natural numbers n, the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to n(n+1)/2"" is true, you would need to prove that it is true for the base case n = 0. In this case, the sum of the first 0 natural numbers is 0, and 0(0+1)/2 = 0, so the statement is true for the base case.\n\n\n\nOnce you have proved that the statement is true for the base case, you must then assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number, say k. Using this assumption, you must then prove that the statement must be true for the next natural number, k+1. For example, if you are trying to prove the statement above, you would assume that the sum of the first k natural numbers is equal to k(k+1)/2, and then use this assumption to prove that the sum of the first k+1 natural numbers is equal to (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\n\n\nIf you can successfully prove the statement for the base case and for the next natural number, then you can use mathematical induction to conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers. This is because the base case and the next natural number are both true, and if the statement is true for one natural number, it must also be true for the next natural number, and so on. Therefore, by repeating this process indefinitely, you can prove that the statement is true for all natural numbers.']","Mathematical induction is a proof technique to prove statements about integers. If you want to prove a statement is true for all positive numbers, mathematical induction is a way to go.
Mathematically, the steps for mathematical induction can be described as follow: 
First, we establish what is called the base case, where we show that the statement is true when N is 1. 
After that, we establish what is called the induction case, where we assume that the statement is true for a randomly chosen number  k, and with that assumption, we want to prove that the statement will be true for k + 1. 
Mathematical induction tell us that, if we can prove both the base case and the induction case, then we can be confident that  using the same logic the statement will also be true for all positive number. 

The explanation above is more formalistic. Essentially, what Mathematical Induction allow us to do is to prove a statement for infinite amount of number by proving the statement for 1 specific number and then proving that if the statement holds for k, it will also hold for k+1.

It is composed of a pair of mathematical functions: one is the likelihood function, which tries to calculates the possibility for different explanation being the cause, and the other one is the prior distribution, which indicates our initial belief of different explanations. And put those two together, we could have a posterior distribution, that can tell us the most possible explanation. In that way, we could do our decision making based on the updated posterior distribution, rather than the raw data， and designed experiments. 为了更好地去刻画真实世界的情况，有些时候我们需要人为手动去引入一些限制条件，比如我们可能知道那个解释肯定是关于某个特征的函数等等。而这个模型就需要研究人员去定义它的形式，在我们对模型的形式做合理假设的同时也需要考虑到模型的解释能力是否足够，现实可能性是否存在。通过对这些模型参数的推断，我们能够更好地去获取到数据背后的隐藏信息。由于统计模型的拟合需要牺牲模型的简易性，经常要求大量的计算，而这些计算涉及到的统计学的知识和方法就是统计模型学的一部分。 Stat Model真好我好想是机器学经，对自己的方法有一个自己的拟合，例如说Berkson paradox, classifer-aware, propensity score 等等。"

The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).\nReal numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.\nConversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.\nThe informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field.[d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations.

The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis.\nDiagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific. For example, redness of the skin (erythema), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis, in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom (or a group of several) that is pathognomonic.\nDiagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor's visit.

"Please explain what is ""Predictive modeling""","['Predictive modelling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.\nIn many cases the model is chosen on the basis of detection theory to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an email determining how likely that it is spam.\nModels can use one or more classifiers in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set. For example, a model might be used to determine whether an email is spam or ""ham"" (non-spam).\nDepending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of machine learning, as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as predictive analytics.\nPredictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis.  In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest. In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships. This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that ""correlation does not imply causation"".']","[""Predictive modeling is a process in which a model is developed to make predictions about future outcomes based on historical data.

It is applied to many fields such as financial forecasting and medicine. The goal of predictive modeling is to simplify the complex datasets, identify patterns and relationships within datasets, and generate predictive models to predict future events.

The model identifies patterns of the stock price fluctuation and formulates them into mathematical equations. It then applies these equations to predict future stock prices. This process may involve familiar tools in math and programming, such as probability theory and computer science algorithms. Besides, predictive modeling often requires massive historical datasets as training data and it might take a long time to finish the modeling at times.

"Please explain what is ""Leaf node""","['In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or ""loops"" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes in a single straight line.\nBinary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of children for each parent to exactly two. When the order of the children is specified, this data structure corresponds to an  ordered tree in graph theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children.\nThe abstract data type can be represented in a number of ways, including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list). Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes or ancestor lists for performance.\nTrees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and trees in descriptive set theory.']","['In a tree data structure, a leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over all pairs of data points computed using Inner products. The feature map in kernel machines is infinite dimensional but only requires a finite dimensional matrix from user-input according to the Representer theorem. Kernel machines are slow to compute for datasets larger than a couple of thousand examples without parallel processing. \nKernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.  This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates.  This approach is called the ""kernel trick"". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors.\nAlgorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support-vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others.\nMost kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded.

"Please explain what is ""Linear regression""","['In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.\nIn linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.\nLinear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications. This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\nLinear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:\nLinear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the ""lack of fit"" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models.

It is a widely used technique for predicting a continuous outcome.\n\n\n\nIn linear regression, the relationship between the dependent variable (which is the variable we are trying to predict) and the independent variable(s) (which are the factors that might influence the dependent variable) is modeled using a linear equation. The equation has the form:\n\n\n\ny = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn\n\n\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the regression coefficients.

It assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear, which may not always be the case.

The main idea of Linear regression is to find coefficients that minimize the distance between predicted results and real result. The distance is the sum of L2 distances between the prediction and the true sentence, so we need to find the best coefficient to minimize it.

Then, in order to minimize the distance, during the training process, we will try to adjust the coefficient, and using some gradient descent, improving the prediction performance. Finally, we could use this model to give us a prediction on whether this sentence is positive, negative or neutral.

After training, we could use the trained model to predict the sentiment scores in a new dataset. However, we need to remember that the training can only apply to a new testing dataset if two datasets are from the same domain or human level performance. "
"Please explain what is ""Ordinary least squares""","['In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) is a type of linear least squares method for choosing the unknown parameters in a linear regression model (with fixed level-one effects of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables) by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the input dataset and the output of the (linear) function of the independent variable.\nGeometrically, this is seen as the sum of the squared distances, parallel to the axis of the dependent variable, between each data point in the set and the corresponding point on the regression surface—the smaller the differences, the better the model fits the data. The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula, especially in the case of a simple linear regression, in which there is a single regressor on the right side of the regression equation.\nThe OLS estimator is consistent for the level-one fixed effects when the regressors are exogenous and forms perfect colinearity (rank condition), consistent for the variance estimate of the residuals when regressors have finite fourth moments  and—by the Gauss–Markov theorem—optimal in the class of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and serially uncorrelated. Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite variances.

"Please explain what is ""Ridge regression""","['Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated.

In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).\nThe theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.\nRidge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.']","['Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that aims to address the problem of multicollinearity, which occurs when predictors in a regression model are correlated. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and inconsistent coefficient estimates, which can make it difficult to interpret the results of a regression model.

This shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, which can help to stabilize the model and improve its interpretability.\n\n\n\nRidge regression is implemented by adding a penalty term to the least squares objective function, which is the objective function that is minimized in linear regression. The penalty term is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. The objective function for ridge regression is given by:\n\n\n\n$J(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$\n\n\n\nWhere $\\beta$ is the vector of coefficients, $y_i$ is the response variable, $x_{ij}$ is the predictor variable, and $\\lambda$ is the penalty hyperparameter.

However, it is important to tune the penalty hyperparameter to ensure that the model is not over- or under-regularized. Over-regularization can lead to a model that is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data, while under-regularization can result in a model that is too complex and overfits the data.']","Ridge regression is a regularization technique for linear regression, which is a popular model for prediction and causal inference in econometrics. Unlike OLS, ridge regression performs well even some of the predictors in the model are highly correlated with each other, which violates the OLS ordinary least square assumption.  Ridge regression resolve it by adding a penalty term to the OLS loss function. This penalty term aims to shrink the regression coefficients toward zero, which significantly reduces the variance of the estimates, and thus reduces the potential overfit of the model. Regularizing the model makes the estimate more robust, and it's particularly useful when we have high dimensionality, which increases the complexity of the model fitting process. To introduce the penalty term, ridge regression relies one tuning parameter lambda, which is based on the principle that the larger the lambda, the more substantial the shrinkage. As lambda approaches zero, ridge regression resembles ordinary linear regression, while a larger lambda increases the penalty and the shrinkage effect."

"Please explain what is ""Directed acyclic graph""","['In mathematics, particularly graph theory, and computer science, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions. DAGs have numerous scientific and computational applications, ranging from biology (evolution, family trees, epidemiology) to information science (citation networks) to computation (scheduling).\nDirected acyclic graphs are sometimes instead called acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.']","['A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a type of directed graph that has no cycles.

Similar to a typical graph, a DAG is composed of a set of nodes (also called vertices). However, different from a typical graph, each edge of a DAG is directed: it points from one node towards another. Furthermore, a DAG does not have any loops, or cycles. This topological feature makes DAG very useful in certain situations. 

For instance, in the field of scheduling, one can use a DAG to represent the dependencies among different tasks. From the DAG, one can easily check the topological order of these tasks, which helps determine the correct order of execution. Furthermore, one can also utilize DAG to represent the dependency among processes or threads in a distributed system: again, it helps determine the correct order of execution. At last, DAG can also be applied to outlier detection and model-free estimation, where one need to identify the cause of a datapoint by iteratively study its dependency on previous datapoints. 

Overall, DAG has been successfully utilized in a variety of real-world applications, that makes it quite useful in distributed systems, scheduling (both for classes and for CPU), or even computer vision!"

Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics,[10] image processing, signal processing,[11] control theory,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] cryptography[15] and telecommunications.[16] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.[17][18][19]\nApplications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes.

K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time.[23] These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes,[24] and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.[22][25]\nThe term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[26][27] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space.[28][29] The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables.[28][30] But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line.[30] If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead.[31] The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.[29]\nBased on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks,[32] martingales,[33] Markov processes,[34] Lévy processes,[35] Gaussian processes,[36] random fields,[37] renewal processes, and branching processes.[38] The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology[39][40][41] as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.[42][43][44] The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics[45] and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.[46][47][48]']","['A stochastic process is a mathematical model for a sequence of events or values that evolve over time in a random manner.

"Please explain what is ""Natural selection""","['Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term ""natural selection"", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic\n(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.\nNatural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin\'s influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin\'s writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.']","[""Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature as a result of certain inherited traits being more or less advantageous for an individual's survival and reproduction in a particular environment. These advantageous traits tend to be passed on to future generations, while disadvantageous traits tend to be selected against and are less likely to be passed on. This process ultimately leads to the evolution of species over time.\n\n\n\nThe theory of natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century, and it remains one of the most important concepts in the field of biology. According to the theory, natural selection occurs because individuals within a population vary in their traits, and some of these traits are more advantageous than others in a particular environment. For example, a population of gazelles that live in a grassland habitat may have individuals with longer legs, which allow them to run faster and escape from predators more effectively. These individuals would be more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, the trait of long legs would be more common in the population over time.\n\n\n\nNatural selection is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, and it has shaped the diversity of life on Earth as we know it today.""]","Natural selection is a process where the organisms that are best adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations. The concept was theorized by Charles Darwin in his book ""On the Origin of Species"" and is one of most important ideas in the field of biology. In every generation, there are always a lot of variation in physical composition among organism, such as the length of their neck. Some organisms might have their neck being longer, whereas some of them might have their neck being shorter. However, those with longer necks have a higher probability of survive because they will be able to reach the food source while the others cannot. Consequently, those organisms whose physical composition are not adapted to the environment tend to die and such biology characteristic will not be inherited into the next generation. On the other hand, some of the organisms are lucky enough to have an advantageous physical composition. Those organisms tend to survive and continue to evolve over thousands of years to what we call ""evolution""."

Newly generated solutions are typically mutated before being added to the population.\nDifferent algorithms in evolutionary computation may use different data structures to store genetic information, and each genetic representation can be recombined with different crossover operators. Typical data structures that can be recombined with crossover are bit arrays, vectors of real numbers, or trees.']","['In a genetic algorithm, crossover is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to produce offspring that inherits characteristics from both parents. Crossover is a key component of genetic algorithms because it allows the algorithm to mix and recombine the characteristics of different solutions, leading to the discovery of new, potentially better solutions.\n\n\n\nCrossover works by selecting a point in the genetic material of the two parents, known as a crossover point, and swapping the genetic material on either side of the point between the two parents to create two new offspring. For example, if the parents have the following genetic material:\n\n\n\nParent 1: [A B C D E F G]\n\nParent 2: [H I J K L M N]\n\n\n\nCrossover point: 4\n\n\n\nOffspring 1: [A B C H I J K]\n\nOffspring 2: [D E F L M N G]\n\n\n\nIn this example, the crossover point is chosen at position 4 in the genetic material of the two parents, and the genetic material on either side of the point is swapped to create two new offspring.

By mixing and recombining the genetic material of different solutions, crossover helps the genetic algorithm to discover new, potentially better solutions that may not be obvious by simply mutating a single solution.']","Crossover happens to a gene when it combines with another gene into the next generation in the genetic algorithm. By doing so, it exchanges information and enable more complex tracking of the target problem. However, to make crossover happen is by reducing mutation, or the exchanging of information is not significant. However, the following section demonstrated that a more complicated problem suggested lower probability crossover and a higher probability of mutation. I believed this is because as the task becomes more challenging, the exploring of the solution space becomes more important. Therefore, a simple combining of two simpler solutions does not provide a sufficient exploration. This is why for the one-max and linked-list problem, crossover enhances performance."
