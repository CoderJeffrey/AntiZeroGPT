"Weight decay is a technique used in machine learning and deep learning to reduce complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the weight values of the model. weight decay term is called the weight decay term, and it is typically multiplied by a hyperparameter, which determines the strength of the regularization. In practice, weight decay is often implemented by adding a term to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model weights. Weights = weights - learning_rate * (gradient + weight_decay_rate * * weights) The effect of weight decay is to encourage the weights of the model to take smaller values, which can help prevent overfitting.

Once trained, the model can then be used to analyze new text and identify its structure and meaning. However, advances in machine learning techniques have made it possible to build highly accurate grammar induction models that can analyze and understand natural language with a high degree of accuracy. These models can be used in a variety of applications, such as language translation, text classification, and information extraction. "
